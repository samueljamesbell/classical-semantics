Gaetano Greco (c. 1657 – c. 1728) was an Italian Baroque composer. He was the younger brother of Rocco Greco ( c.1650 - before 1718). Both brothers were trained at, and later taught at the Poveri di Gesu` Cristo conservatory in Naples. Gaetano Greco's teachers included Giovanni Salvatore and Gennaro Ursino , and possibly Francesco Provenzale .  It is also possible that he studied with Alessandro Scarlatti. Leonardo Vinci , Giuseppe Porsile, Nicola Porpora, and Domenico Scarlatti (perhaps also Giovanni Battista Pergolesi) were among his pupils. His successor at the conservatory was Francesco Durante.
