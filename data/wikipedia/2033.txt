Rodolphe Kreutzer (15 November 1766  – 6 January 1831) was a French violinist , teacher, conductor , and composer of forty French operas , including La mort d'Abel (1810). He is probably best known as the dedicatee of Beethoven 's Violin Sonata No. 9 , Op. 47 (1803), though he never played the work. Kreutzer made the acquaintance of Beethoven in 1798, when at Vienna in the service of the French ambassador, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte (later King of Sweden and Norway).  Beethoven originally dedicated the sonata to George Bridgetower , the violinist at its first performance, but after a quarrel he revised the dedication in favour of Kreutzer. Kreutzer was born in Versailles , and was initially taught by his German father, who was a musician in the royal chapel, with later lessons from Anton Stamitz . He became one of the foremost violin virtuosos of his day, appearing as a soloist until 1810. He was a violin professor at the Conservatoire de Paris from its foundation in 1795 until 1826. He was co-author of the Conservatoire's violin method with Pierre Rode and Pierre Baillot , and the three are considered the founding trinity of the French school of violin playing. For a time, Kreutzer was leader of the Paris Opera , and from 1817 he conducted there too. He died in Geneva and is buried in Paris at the Père Lachaise Cemetery . He was well known for his style of bowing , his splendid tone, and the clearness of his execution. His compositions include nineteen violin concertos and forty operas . His best-known works, however, are the 42 études ou caprices ( 42 Études or Capriccios , 1796) which are fundamental pedagogic studies.
