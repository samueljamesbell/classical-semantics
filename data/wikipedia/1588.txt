Frederick Grant Gleason (born 17 December 1848 in Middletown, Connecticut - died Chicago , 6 December 1903) was an American composer , and director of the Chicago Conservatory from 1900-1903. Gleason's father was a banker . Like many other well-to-do gentlemen, Gleason senior was an amateur flautist . He considered music a pleasant pastime but not a serious occupation. He wanted his son to enter the ministry - a good old New England tradition. But the son insisted on becoming a composer, and the father yielded. Gleason spent much of his early life in the neighboring city of Hartford, as a pupil of Dudley Buck , going in 1869 to Leipzig to study with Ignaz Moscheles and Hans Richter .  After six years in Europe he returned to America, and in 1877 went to Chicago as a member of the faculty of the Hershey School of Music, of which Clarence Eddy (also a pupil of Buck) was the general director.  Gleason was also active as a music critic. In 1897 he became president of an organization called the 'American Patriotic Musical League'. He was general director of the Chicago Conservatory from 1900-1903.  According to Philo A. Otis, Gleason "was an idealist, a dreamer, though too much of a follower to be a leader."  Gleason's compositions include: the Festival Ode (words by Harriet Monroe ) sung by 500 voices with orchestra at the opening of the Auditorium Theatre , Chicago on 9 December 1889;   Processional of the Holy Grail written for the Chicago World's Fair ; a symphonic Poem , Edris , based on a novel by Marie Corelli ; the tone poem Song of Life (after a poem by Swinburne); a Piano Concerto ; a cantata with orchestra, The Culprit Fay ; and two operas : Otho Visconti and Montezuma . The former was produced at Chicago in 1907. He left other scores in manuscript, with instructions that they were not to publicly performed until fifty years after his death.
