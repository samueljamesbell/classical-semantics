(Jean Baptiste) Charles Dancla (19 December 1817 – 10 October 1907) was a French violinist, composer and teacher. Dancla was born in Bagnères-de-Bigorre . When he was nine years old, violinist Pierre Rode in Bordeaux heard his music; he was so impressed that he sent a recommendation letter to Pierre Baillot , Luigi Cherubini and Rodolphe Kreutzer . Thus Dancla went to the Paris Conservatory and studied with Baillot for violin and Fromental Halévy for composition. He was strongly influenced by Niccolò Paganini , whom he heard in 1830, as well as by Henri Vieuxtemps . From 1835 onward Dancla was solo violinist in the Paris Opéra, and shortly thereafter he became concert master . In 1857 he was made a professor at the Paris Conservatory where he was a successful teacher for over 35 years. He died in Tunis . His two brothers were Arnaud Dancla (1819–1862), cellist and author of a considerable cello teaching method, and Leopold Dancla (1822–1895), violinist and composer of chamber music.
