Andreas Werckmeister (November 30, 1645 – October 26, 1706) was a German organist, music theorist , and composer of the Baroque era . Born in Benneckenstein , Werckmeister attended schools in Nordhausen and Quedlinburg . He received his musical training from his uncles Heinrich Christian Werckmeister and Heinrich Victor Werckmeister . In 1664 he became an organist in Hasselfelde ; ten years later in Elbingerode ; and in 1696 of the Martinskirche in Halberstadt . Of his compositions only a booklet remains: pieces for violin with basso continuo , with the title Musikalische Privatlust (1689). Werckmeister is best known today as a theorist, in particular through his writings Musicae mathematicae hodegus curiosus... (1687) and Musikalische Temperatur (1691), in which he described a system of what we would now refer to as well temperament (named after Bach's opus, " The Well-Tempered Clavier ") now known as Werckmeister temperament . Werckmeister's writings were well known to Johann Sebastian Bach , in particular his writings on counterpoint . Werckmeister believed that well-crafted counterpoint, in particular invertible counterpoint  , was tied to the orderly movements of the planets, reminiscent of Kepler 's view in Harmonice Mundi .  According to George Buelow, "No other writer of the period regarded music so unequivocally as the end result of God’s work,"  a view harmonious with that of Bach. Yet in spite of his focus on counterpoint, Werckmeister's work emphasized underlying harmonic principles.
