Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla (ca. 1590 – 1664) was a Spanish composer in what is modern Mexico . He was born in Málaga, Spain but moved to Puebla , Mexico , in 1620 to compose music in the New World. At the time New Spain was a viceroyalty of Spain that included modern day Mexico , Guatemala , the Philippines and other parts of Central America and the Caribbean . Padilla is one of the more important composers represented in the manuscripts at Puebla, Mexico and the Hackenberry collection in Chicago, Illinois . He worked at Puebla de Los Angeles, Mexico, which in Baroque times was a bigger religious center than Mexico City itself. He was appointed maestro de capilla of Puebla Cathedral in 1628. He is to be distinguished from a younger Juan de Padilla, who was maestro de capilla at Zamora, Spain (1661-1663), and Toledo (1663-1673). The majority of his vast output (over 700 pieces survive) include sacred motets , often for double choir, in the Renaissance style or stile antico as well as sacred villancicos . It often includes accompaniments for organ or various stringed instruments. Padilla's music is rather difficult to get hold of: Mapa Mundi , publish singing scores of some of this music including the double choir piece Deus in Adiutorium Meum Intende. Alfredston Music can provide instrumental parts for the smaller pieces in their collection. There are at least 2 PhD theses with Padilla's music in the appendices:

Catalyne, The Double-choir Music of Juan de Padilla , (diss., Univ. of Southern California, 1953). Benjamín Juárez Echenique has recorded a Mass and two sets of Christmas villancicos for Urtext digital classics:
