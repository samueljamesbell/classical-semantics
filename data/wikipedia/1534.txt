Giuseppe Gazzaniga (5 October 1743 – 1 February 1818) was  a member of the Neapolitan school of opera composers .  He composed fifty-one operas and is considered to be one of the last Italian opera buffa composers. Born in Verona , Gazzaniga was initially intended for the priesthood at the urging of his devout parents. He eventually convinced his father to allow him to pursue a career in music and began studies first in Venice and then at the Conservatorio di Sant'Onofrio a Porta Capuana in Naples . While there, he was a pupil of Niccolò Piccinni and Nicola Porpora . Gazzaniga presented his first opera, Il barone di Trocchia , at the Teatro di San Carlo in 1768.  He would spend the next several decades writing mostly operas in Italy with the exception of a few trips to Dresden , Vienna , and Prague . His most successful opera was his Don Giovanni Tenorio written in 1787 to a libretto by Giovanni Bertati , possibly an inspiration for the libretto of Mozart 's Don Giovanni . His last opera, Martino Carbonaro , was performed at the Teatro San Moisè in Venice in  1801.  He also wrote a symphony and three piano concertos.  In 1791, he  became musical director of Crema Cathedral in the Lombardy region of northern Italy , where he composed numerous sacred works including several cantatas , oratorios , and masses . He remained in that position until his death in 1818.  His life and works were the subject of a detailed study by the prominent 19th-century German critic Friedrich Chrysander .
