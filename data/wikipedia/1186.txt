Charles Dollé ( fl. 1735 – 1755) was a French viol player and composer . Very little is known about his life. He was active in Paris and was a sought-after teacher of viol. His music, all of which involves the viol in some way, was influenced by Marin Marais (whose death the composer commemorated in a tombeau ) and Italian style, which is most prominent in Dollé's late works (although they retain the characteristically French ornamentation). Dollé's music survives in five printed collections (all published in Paris): Another print, Livres troisième, pour le pardessus de viole, tant à cinq qu'à six cordes (op. 5, c. 1749-1750), is lost. The extant music includes character pieces (twenty-five in op. 3, five in op. 4).
