Sethus Calvisius or Setho Calvisio , originally Seth Kalwitz (21 February 1556 – 24 November 1615), was a German music theorist , composer, chronologer , astronomer , and teacher of the late Renaissance . He was born into a peasant family at Gorsleben in present-day Thuringia . By the exercise of his musical talents he earned money enough for the start, at Helmstedt , of a university career, which the aid of a wealthy patron enabled him to continue at Leipzig . He became director of the music-school at Pforta in 1572. In 1594 he was transferred to Leipzig in the same post, including directing the Thomanerchor at the Thomaskirche .  He retained this post until his death in Leipzig , despite the offers successively made to him of mathematical professorships at Frankfurt and Wittenberg . Calvisius was also a significant astronomer: in his Opus Chronologicum (Leipzig, 1605, 7th ed. 1685) he expounded a system based on the records of nearly 300 eclipses . An ingenious, though ineffective, proposal for the reform of the calendar was put forward in his Elenchus Calendarii Gregoriani (Frankfurt, 1612); and he published a book on music , Melodiae condendae ratio ( Erfurt , 1592). He composed choral pieces including Unser Leben währet siebzig Jahr .
