Carl (or Karl ) Joseph Millöcker ( ( 1842-04-29 ) 29 April 1842 – ( 1899-12-31 ) 31 December 1899), was an Austrian composer of operettas and a conductor . He was born in Vienna , where he studied the flute at the Vienna Conservatory . While holding various conducting posts in the city, he began to compose operettas . The first was Der tote Gast , an operetta in one act, premiered in 1865 with libretto by Ludwig Harisch, after the novel by Heinrich Zschokke . The international success of Der Bettelstudent enabled him to retire from conducting. However, he never achieved a comparable success afterward. Carl Millöcker died in Baden bei Wien ; on 31 December 1899, he was buried in an honorary grave in Vienna's Zentralfriedhof cemetery (group 32, A35).   See List of operettas and operas by Millöcker .
