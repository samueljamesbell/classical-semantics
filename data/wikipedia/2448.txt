Bernhard Molique ( Wilhelm Bernhard Molique; 7 October 1802 – 10 May 1869) was a  German violinist and composer. He was born in Nuremberg . His father was a musician and the boy studied various instruments, but finally devoted himself to the violin. In 1815, he received some lessons from Louis Spohr , and then studied the violin for two years at the University of Munich under Pietro Rovelli . In 1820, Molique succeeded Rovelli as court violinist in Munich and, after several successful tours, in 1826 he became music director at Stuttgart . He died in Cannstatt in 1869. One of his pupils was the violinist Henry Blagrove . As a composer, Molique was unapologetically self-taught. His music displays the influence of Beethoven, Mozart, Mendelssohn and, especially, Louis Spohr . The then radical developments represented by Berlioz (who publicly praised his violin playing) and the New German School ( German : Neudeutschen Schule ) left Molique untouched, however. His Cello Concerto was successfully played in Baden-Baden , by Léon Jacquard , conducted by Hector Berlioz , on August 27, 1860. He also wrote some charming songs.
