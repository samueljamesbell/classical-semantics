John Marsh (31 May 1752 â€“ 31 October 1828) was an English gentleman, composer, diarist and writer born in Dorking , England .  A lawyer by training, he is known to have written at least 350 compositions, including at least 39 symphonies. While today known primarily for his music, he also had strong interest in other fields, including astronomy and philosophy , and wrote books about astronomy, music, religion, and geometry . Marsh lived in Dorking, Gosport, Romsey, Salisbury and Canterbury before settling in Chichester in 1787 until his death in 1828.  As a concert organizer, he was responsible for the music making in the towns and cities where he worked, especially in Chichester, where he led the subscription concerts for some 35 years. Marsh was perhaps the most prolific English composer of his time. His own catalog of compositions records over 350 works, of which he lists 39 symphonies. Of these, only the nine that Marsh had printed are extant, together with three one-movement finales. Marsh was a man of varied interests, and his 37 volumes of journals are among the most valuable sources of information on life and music in 18th-century England.  They represent one of the most important musical and social documents of the period.  It remained unpublished until the first volume was published in 1998.  In one passage, Marsh describes the great Handel Commemoration of 1784 in London. Marsh's son was poet and cleric Edward Garrard Marsh .
