Augusta Browne (1820–1882) was an American composer who became renowned in the 1850s as part of the first wave of female composers in the country.  She was the most prolific of that group,  and Wake, Lady Mine , written in 1845, is one of her most well-known works.  Augusta Browne Garrett was a female composer, publisher , author , and trailblazer during a time when men dominated each of those fields. Born in 1820 in Dublin, Ireland , she is celebrated as "the most prolific woman composer in America before 1870".  She composed over 200 works  for piano and voice in addition to numerous hymns and secular pieces.  Browne was driven by the desire to write and produce music for the masses. She often collaborated with either men or women, creating musical settings to accompany lyrics written by her musical partner. In addition to her musical works, her articles and journals led her to be respected in the literary world as well,  where she published two books – one about her brother entitled Hamilton, the Young Artist — essays , religious tracts , poetry , and short stories . She was dedicated to her opinions, and was willing to express those that rebutted common beliefs and interests at the time. One of her most famous articles criticized the popular " minstrel music" of the mid-1800s, calling it "melodic trash", an idea which at the time made more than a few people cringe. Despite this affront, her article was reprinted in several music journals – quite a feat for a woman at that time. In many ways, Browne influenced the realization of women and their accomplishments in music and the arts. Augusta Browne now is buried in New York’s Green-Wood Cemetery .
