Heinrich Schwemmer (28 March 1621 – 31 May 1696) was a German music teacher and composer . He was born in Gumpertshausen bei Hallburg , Lower Franconia , and moved with his mother to Weimar after his father’s death in 1627, to get away from the Thirty Years War . After his mother's death in 1638, he moved to Coburg , then in 1641 to Nuremberg , where he remained for the rest of his life. He studied music with Kindermann at the Sebaldusschule , and in 1650 himself became a teacher, effectively a Kantor without the title; from 1656 he was Director chori musici along with Paul Hainlein . Along with Georg Caspar Wecker , he taught a generation of musicians in the tradition of the South German school , including Nikolaus Deinl , Johann Krieger , Johann Löhner , Johann Pachelbel , J.B. Schütz , and Maximilian Zeidler . Schwemmer taught singing , while Wecker gave instruction in keyboard playing and composition . All his known compositions, of which there a considerable number in manuscript, are vocal works: mostly sacred strophic songs for weddings and funerals , with some cantatas and chorale concertos . He was a master of the concertato vocal style.
