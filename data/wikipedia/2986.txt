Ludwig Schmidseder (24 August 1904, in Passau â€“ 21 June 1971, in Munich ) was a German composer and pianist of the "Light Muse". Several of his Schlager compositions are still popular tunes today. The young Schmidseder followed his father's wishes and trained as a banker , whilst taking piano lessons in secret. He furthered his musical education at the Munich Conservatorium , then left for South America in 1926, ending up in Rio de Janeiro . Starting out as a dishwasher , he went on to become an entertainer and play in a trio on ocean cruises. Schmidseder composed music for the trio, and developed into a virtuoso piano player. From 1930 he worked in Berlin , composing film music, creating operettas and writing more than 500 songs, some of which became much-loved hits. He moved from being a bar pianist (until 1936) to being the house composer at the old Berlin Metropol-Theatre . His operetta Die Oder Keine ( That One or No One ) was performed more than 600 times. Schmidseder joined the NSDAP on 1 May 1933.  After World War II , Schmidseder continued to compose film music and appear in films. The corpulent cook would later become famous as a TV cook and produced a book of recipes.
