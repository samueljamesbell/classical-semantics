Jack Hamilton Beeson (July 15, 1921 – June 6, 2010) was an American composer.  He was known particularly for his operas, the best known of which are Lizzie Borden , Hello Out There! and The Sweet Bye and Bye . Born in Muncie, Indiana , Beeson began with music when he started piano lessons with Luella Weimer in 1928, but it was not until 1933 that he began to compose. He decided to become an "opera-composer" after being influenced by Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts . From 1936 until 1939, he switched piano teachers and was with Percival Owen during this period of time. In 1938 he received certificates with first class honors in piano and theory from the Conservatory of Music at the University of Toronto , a very well earned accomplishment at the age of 21. From 1944 to 1945 he had private studies with Béla Bartók in New York City. At this time he was also associating with the Columbia University Opera Workshop and the opera productions of Columbia Theatre Associates. This led to the first performance of his music in New York City. Throughout 1946 and 1947 Beeson was adapting Paul Goodman's play and composing the music for Jonah as well as writing and performing the Fifth Sonata on piano. Beeson won the Prix de Rome and  Fulbright scholarship which allowed him to live in Rome from 1948–1950.  During this time, he completed Jonah and then returned to teaching and opera productions at Columbia. The year of 1953/1954, he adapted Saroyan's play as a libretto and composed Hello Out There as well as superintending its first performance. From 1955 to 1958 he collaborated with Kenward Elmslie on The Sweet Bye and Bye , first performed at the Juilliard School.  From 1958 to 1959 he wrote three orchestral works and numerous smaller pieces. During 1965 and 1967 he recorded and published Lizzie Borden, which was televised by NET Opera and revived by the New York City Opera. That same year, he also became MacDowell Professor of Music at Columbia. From 1981 to 1991 he wrote Cyrano , a heroic comedy in music, with Sheldon Harnick. He then chose early retirement from Columbia in 1988, but returned as a member of the Society of Senior Scholars. In May 2010, he was awarded a Letter of Distinction from the American Music Center.  His notable students include Charles Wuorinen , John Kander , Phillip Ramey , Alice Shields , Joan Tower , Harvey Sollberger , Michael Rosenzweig , Bright Sheng , Mark Birnbaum, and Richard Einhorn . Beeson died June 6, 2010, in New York City , New York .
