Antonia Padoani Bembo (ca. 1640 – ca. 1720) was an Italian composer and singer. She was born in Venice ,  the daughter of Giacomo Padoani (1603-1666), a doctor, and Diana Pareschi (1609-1676); she married the venetian noble Lorenzo Bembo (1637-1703) in 1659. She moved to Paris before 1676, possibly to leave a bad marriage. There she sang for Louis XIV . Louis granted her a pension and housing at the Petite Union Chrétienne des Dames de Saint Chaumont, a religious community.  She was a contemporary of Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre and Barbara Strozzi .  Six volumes of Bembo's music survive in manuscript at the Bibliothèque nationale de France as the Produzioni armoniche , most of them dedicated to Louis XIV. These contain a certain amount of autobiographical information, which has been corroborated through other sources. She was taught by Francesco Cavalli (who also taught Barbara Strozzi ) by 1654 and wrote in all the major genres of the time, including opera , secular and sacred cantatas, and petit and grand motets . Her work is a combination of French and Italian styles. She uses the virtuosic elements of Italian style of the period, as well as French dance forms. Much of her work is for soprano voice with continuo accompaniment. She wrote an opera called L'Ercole amante (1707), to a libretto by Francesco Buti .
