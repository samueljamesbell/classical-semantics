Carlo Milanuzzi (c. 1590 – c. 1647) was an Italian composer of the early Baroque era. Carlo Milanuzzi was born in Santa Natoglia, or Esanatoglia in the Marche region , to Milanuzzo and donna Felice, probably around 1590, but not after 1592, the starting-date of the Baptismal Books of the town, in which no documentation of his birth has been found.  He spent most of his life in Venice . Though he was an Augustinian friar, he composed both sacred and secular music, and his work is very interesting particularly for the later development of the solo cantata . As Dinko Fabris wrote: «the collections of Ariose vaghezze published by Milanuzzi in Venice between 1622 and 1643 were a veritable mine of arias and proto-cantatas that had numerous affinities with Falconieri »; into the collections there are inserted many dances , and a quantity of them are for Spanish guitar .  For example, the 'Terzo scherzo delle ariose vaghezze' of Milanuzzi contains 12 ballettos for solo voice and continuo , and 7 for guitar alone. Two short arias by Francesco Monteverdi, elder son of Claudio Monteverdi , survive in Milanuzzi’s 'Quarto scherzo delle ariose vaghezze'. Milanuzzi died perhaps around 1647, the date of his last work, Compieta intiera concertata con le Antifone, e Litanie della Beatiss. Vergine Madre di Dio . In 1621 Carlo Milanuzzi also added the 'continuo' part to Pomponio Nenna ’s Il primo libro de madrigali , 4 vv. The motet Anima miseranda , appeared in ' Ghirlanda sacra scielta da diuersi Eccellentissimi Compositori', an anthology by various authors edited in Venice, 1625.
