Ascanio Mayone (ca. 1565 – 1627) was a Neapolitan composer and harpist. He trained as a pupil of Giovanni de Macque in Naples , and worked at Santissima Annunziata Maggiore there as organist from 1593 and maestro di cappella from 1621; he was also organist at the royal chapel from 1602. He published madrigals , but his main work is his two volumes of keyboard music, Capricci per sonar (1603, 1609). These contain canzonas , toccatas , variations, and arrangements of vocal pieces, many of which are distinctively Baroque rather than Renaissance in style.
