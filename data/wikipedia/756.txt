Giuseppe Antonio Brescianello (also Bressonelli;  ca. 1690, Bologna – 4 October 1758, Stuttgart ) was an Italian Baroque composer and violinist . His name is mentioned for the first time in a document from 1715 in which the Maximilian II Emanuel appointed him violinist in his court orchestra in Munich . Soon after, in 1716, after the death of Johann Christoph Pez , he got the job of music director and as a maître des concerts de la chambre at the Württemberg court in Stuttgart . In 1717, he was appointed Hofkapellmeister . Around 1718, he composed the pastorale opera La Tisbe , which he dedicated to the Archduke Eberhard Ludwig . Brescianello did this in vain hope that his opera would be listed at the Stuttgart theatre. In the years from 1719 to 1721, a fierce conflict emerged, in which Reinhard Keiser repeatedly attempted to get Brescianello's post. In 1731, Brescianello became Oberkapellmeister. In 1737, the court had financial problems which led to the dissolution of the opera staff and Brescianello lost his position. For this reason, he dedicated himself increasingly to composition and this resulted in his 12 concerti e sinphonie op. 1 and some time later the 18 Pieces for gallichone (gallichone here means mandora , a type of lute). In 1744, the financial problems at the court diminished and he was reappointed as Oberkapellmeister by Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg , mostly "because of his special knowledge of music and excellent skills". He led the court and opera music until he was pensioned off in the period between 1751 and 1755. His successors were Ignaz Holzbauer and then Niccolò Jommelli .
