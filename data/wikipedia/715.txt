Fritz Bovet ( fl. 1845-1888) was a Swiss romantic era composer and violinist . The only work now in print by Fritz Bovet is his String Quartet, op. 14, published by Merton Music .  In this publication, Merton refers to a writing of Wilhelm Altmann (1862–1951), who recorded that "this quartet was published in Plymouth in 1911". Merton continues:  "But of Fritz Bovet himself not a word is to be found in any musical reference book .  From publications about the famous Swiss watchmaking firm of Bovet, which had a flourishing trade with China ,  you will learn that Fritz was the grandson of the founder of the firm and was sent to Canton in 1845 where he was noted for playing his violin "with the enthusiasm of a Paganini ," where he collected and transcribed Chinese popular melodies for incorporation in his firm's musical boxes, and where he became French vice-consul." Bovet's String Quartet, op. 14 was republished by Edition Silvertrust with a catalog listing stating that Fritz was a pen name , and that his real identity was Frederck Bovet (1825-1913).  The Bovet website apparently refers to him as Frédéric Bovet, and his brother as Édouard Bovet  It is also reported that in 1888, Bovet Frères was founded by someone who had done his apprenticeship at Fritz Bovet's "watchmaking workshop".
