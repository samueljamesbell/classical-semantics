Yoritsune Matsudaira ( 松平 頼則 , Matsudaira Yoritsune , May 5, 1907, Tokyo , Japan – October 25,  2001 in Tokyo , Japan ) was a Japanese composer of contemporary classical music . Matsudaira was descended, on his father's side of the family, from the Matsudaira clan , related to the Tokugawa clan who ruled Japan as shōgun during the Edo period (specifically from the branch of the family which was enfeoffed at the Hitachi-Fuchū Domain ), and on his mother's side of the family from the Fujiwara clan , who were court regents from the 7th to the 12th centuries. His style was influenced by gagaku , the ancient court music of Japan.  His music has been frequently performed in Europe. His eldest son, Yoriaki (Yori'Aki) Matsudaira ( 松平 頼暁 ) is also a composer.
