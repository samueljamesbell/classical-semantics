Harald Genzmer (9 February 1909 – 16 December 2007) was a German composer of classical music and an academic. Born in Blumenthal , near Bremen , Germany, he studied composition with Paul Hindemith at the Hochschule für Musik Berlin beginning in 1928. From 1938 he taught at the Volksmusikschule Berlin-Neukölln. During the early part of the second world war he served as a military band clarinetist. When his pianistic abilities were noticed by the Musikmeister, he was put on detached duties as a pianist/accompanist for "Lazarettenkonzerte", concerts for recuperating wounded officers.He was based for some time near Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where he made the acquaintance of Richard Strauss . When the war ended, he was offered a post at the Musikhochschule München . This was blocked by the American authorities, and so, from 1946 to 1957 he taught at the Musikhochschule in Freiburg im Breisgau . From 1957 to 1974 he taught at the Musikhochschule München . He hung a framed review from the Süddeutsche Zeitung above his piano, which stated after the premiere of his 1955 Sinfonietta for Strings that it was a work destined only for oblivion. Sharing the frame was a cutting from a few years later, reporting that in the previous year it had been the most performed work for string orchestra in Europe. Among his notable students are Bertold Hummel , the Egyptian composer Gamal Abdel-Rahim and the British composer John McCabe .  See: List of music students by teacher: G to J#Harald Genzmer . He died on 16 December 2007 in Munich.
