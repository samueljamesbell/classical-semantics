Antonio Draghi (ca. 1634  â€“ 16 January 1700) was a Baroque composer. He possibly was the brother of Giovanni Battista Draghi . Draghi was born at Rimini in Italy , and was one of the most prolific composers of his time.  His contribution to the development of Italian opera was particularly significant.  He began his musical career as a choirboy at Padua , but by 1657 he was appearing on stage, in the opera La fortuna di Rodope e di Damira which was produced in Venice .  His first solo effort, the opera La Mascherata , appeared in 1666. In 1668, Draghi was appointed to the court of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor , at Vienna , and he remained there until his death. This is the complete list of the operas of Antonio Draghi.
