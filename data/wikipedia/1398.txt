Heinrich Finck (1444 or 1445 â€“ 9 June 1527) was a German composer . He was probably born at Bamberg , but nothing is certainly known either of the place or date of his birth. Between 1492 and 1506 he was a musician in, and later possibly conductor of the court orchestra of successive kings of Poland at Warsaw . He held the post of conductor at Stuttgart from 1510 till about 1514, then was a composer at the Hofkapelle of Emperor Maximilian I , [ citation needed ] from 1519(?) at the chapter in Salzburg , and in 1527 Hofkapellmeister of Emperor Ferdinand I in Vienna, where he died. His works, mostly part songs and other vocal compositions, show great musical knowledge, and amongst the early masters of the German school he holds a high position. They are found scattered amongst ancient and modern collections of songs and other musical pieces.  The library of Zwickau possesses a work containing a collection of fifty-five songs by Finck, printed about the middle of the 16th century. The German vocal ensemble group " Stimmwerck " has recorded a CD of vocal works by Finck, including his "Missa Dominicalis"; and the Josquin Capella another including his "Missa Ave Preclara".
