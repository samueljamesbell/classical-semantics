Cecil Forsyth (30 November 1870 - 7 December 1941) was an English composer and musicologist . He was born in Greenwich on 30 November 1870, and  died in New York (where he moved in 1914) on 7 December 1941. He studied at the University of Edinburgh and at the Royal College of Music (with Charles Villiers Stanford and Hubert Parry ), and played viola in various London orchestras. His compositions include the Viola Concerto in G minor (which was premiered at the Proms in 1903 with Émile Férir as soloist), the operas Westward Ho! and Cinderella , the "choral ballad" Tinker, Tailor , and a piece for viola and piano called Chanson celtique . His books about music include Music and Nationalism: A Study of English Opera (1911), Choral Orchestration (1920), A History of Music (1916—with Stanford), and A Digest of Music History (1923). Forsyth is arguably best known for his Orchestration , originally published in 1914 and revised in 1935. Dover published a reprint of this revision in 1983 with a new foreword by composer William Bolcom , who lauds especially Forsyth's insight into instrumental culture and his wit. Conductor Adrian Boult recounts in Adrian Boult on Music how Forsyth advised Ralph Vaughan Williams about the orchestration of the latter's A London Symphony .
