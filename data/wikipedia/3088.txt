Her music incorporates elements of jazz , folk music and 20th-century French harmony . Her compositional style has an appealing directness and although tonal, makes interesting use of dissonance . Among her works are The String Quartet , which uses irregular metres and driving rhythms, and the operas Cynthia Parker and Cockcrow , which employ folk music within a generally conservative tonal idiom. Smith was the recipient of several commissions and awards and was active in several music organizations, especially the National Federation of Music Clubs , for which she chaired the Decade of Women Committee (1970–79). As a writer her publications include Aaron Copland: his Work and Contribution to American Music (New York, 1955) and a Directory of American Women Composers (Chicago, 1970), of which she was the editor.
