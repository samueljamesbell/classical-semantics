Philippe  Gaubert (5 July 1879 – 8 July 1941) was a French musician who was a distinguished performer on the flute , a respected conductor , and a composer , primarily for the flute. Gaubert was born in Cahors . He became one of the most prominent French musicians between the two World Wars. After a prominent career as a flautist with the Paris Opéra , he was appointed in 1919, at the age of forty, to three positions that placed him at the very centre of French musical life: In 1907 he participated in the first performance of Maurice Ravel 's Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet . Among his recordings as conductor, one that he made of César Franck 's Symphony in D minor (with the Conservatoire forces) is particularly notable. Gaubert's compositions are not especially innovative, but his work benefited from the examples of Franck, Ravel, and Debussy . Naïla , his opera in three acts, premiered at the Paris Opéra on 7 April 1927. Three of his ballets had their first performances at that venue, as well. During 1941, Gaubert died of a stroke in Paris . [ citation needed ] The government of France named Gaubert a Chevalier de la Legion d'honneur in 1921. [ citation needed ]
