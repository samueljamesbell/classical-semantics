William Child (1606 – 23 March 1697) was an English composer and organist. Born in Bristol , Child was a chorister in the cathedral under the direction of Elway Bevin . In 1630 he began his lifetime association with St. George's Chapel , Windsor Castle , becoming first a lay-clerk and, from 1632, Master of the Choristers there until the dissolution of the chapel in 1643. After the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, Child was re-appointed to St. George's, became Master of the King's Wind Music and a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal . His output of church music is understandably considerable, including a set of psalms (1639), many anthems and 17 service settings . He was often influenced by the Italian 'tastes' of his time, but also wrote anthems in more conventional English forms. Little secular music of Child survives, namely, a number of catches and instrumental pieces.
