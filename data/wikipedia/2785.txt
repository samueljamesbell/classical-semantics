Thomas Ravenscroft ( c. 1588 â€“ 1635) was an English musician, theorist and editor, notable as a composer of rounds and catches , and especially for compiling collections of British folk music . Little is known of Ravenscroft's early life. He probably sang in the choir of St. Paul's Cathedral from 1594, when a Thomas Raniscroft was listed on the choir rolls and remained there until 1600 under the directorship of Thomas Giles. He received his bachelor's degree in 1605 from Cambridge .  Ravenscroft's principal contributions are his collections of folk music , including catches, rounds, street cries , vendor songs, "freeman's songs" and other anonymous music, in three collections: Pammelia (1609), Deuteromelia or The Seconde Part of Musicks Melodie (1609) and Melismata (1611), which contains one of the best-known works in his collections, The Three Ravens . Some of the music he compiled has acquired extraordinary fame, though his name is rarely associated with the music; for example " Three Blind Mice " first appears in Deuteromelia.  He also published a metrical psalter ( The Whole Booke of Psalmes ) in 1621. As a composer, his works are mostly forgotten but include 11 anthems , 3 motets for five voices and 4 fantasias for viols . As a writer, he wrote two treatises on music theory : A Briefe Discourse of the True (but Neglected) Use of Charact'ring the Degrees (London, 1614), and A Treatise of Musick , which remains in manuscript (unpublished).
