Boris Alexandrovich Tchaikovsky ( Russian : Борис Александрович Чайковский ; 10 September 1925 – 7 February 1996), PAU , was a Soviet and Russian composer , born in Moscow , whose oeuvre includes orchestral works, chamber music and film music . He is considered as part of the second generation of Russian composers, following in the steps of Pyotr Tchaikovsky (to whom he was not related  ) and especially Mussorgsky . He was admired by Dmitri Shostakovich , with whom he studied, who (according to Per Skans in his notes for a recording) suggested in a letter of February 1, 1969 to Isaak Glikman, that "If Barshai's orchestra (the Moscow chamber orchestra ) makes a guest appearance in Leningrad playing Vainberg's Tenth Symphony and Boris Tchaikovsky's Sinfonietta, you really have to hear them".
