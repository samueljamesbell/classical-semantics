Michielina (also known as Michaelis or Michieletta ) della Pietà ( fl. ca. 1700 – 1744) was an Italian composer , violinist , organist , and teacher of music. A foundling admitted in infancy to the Ospedale della Pietà in Venice , della Pietà received a thorough musical education from early childhood in the convent's coro , or music school; she became its principal organist and was active as a violinist in the orchestra. As a composer she was active during the tenures of Francesco Gasparini , Giovanni Porta , Nicola Porpora , and Andrea Bernasconi as heads of the school; she was further licensed to teach in 1726. She is known to have composed a litany for the Feast of the Nativity in 1740, and to have written a setting of the hymn Pange lingua in 1741. Nothing further is known of her activities or her life. Along with Agata and Santa della Pietà , della Pietà was one of three foundlings of the Ospedale to become a composer later in life.
