Eugène Gigout ( French: [ʒiɡu] ; 23 March 1844 – 9 December 1925) was a French organist and a composer, mostly of music for his own instrument. Gigout was born in Nancy , and died in Paris . A pupil of Camille Saint-Saëns , he served as the organist of the French capital's Saint-Augustin Church for 62 years. He became widely known as a teacher and his output as a composer was considerable. Renowned as an expert improviser, he also founded his own music school. His nephew by marriage was Léon Boëllmann , another distinguished French composer and organist. The 10 pièces pour orgue (composed 1890) include the Toccata in B minor , Gigout's best-known creation, which turns up as a frequent encore at organ recitals . Also fairly often played, and to be found in the same collection, is a Scherzo in E major .  Other notable pieces by Gigout are Grand chœur dialogué , which dates from 1881, and Marche religieuse . Gigout's works are now available on several commercial recordings. His pupils included the aforementioned Boëllmann, André Fleury , Henri Gagnon , André Marchal , André Messager , Albert Roussel and Victoria Cartier .
