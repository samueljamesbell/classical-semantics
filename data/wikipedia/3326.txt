Vincenzo Valente (February 21, 1855 in Corigliano Calabro – September 6, 1921 in Naples ) was an Italian composer and writer.  He was known for his Neapolitan songs and for his operettas . Valente wrote his first piece, "Ntuniella", at the age of 15; this initiated a successful collaboration with Giambattista De Curtis .  He wrote a total of ten operettas, the best known of which was I granatieri of 1889; he also wrote texts for the actor Nicola Maldacea , known for his macchiette ; he was most famous, though, for his songs, the most famous of which was " Tiempe belle " of 1916. Valente was a member of the so-called Società dello Scorfano , an artistic society which ironically emphasized its supporters' brutishness; among its other members was the poet Ferdinando Russo .
