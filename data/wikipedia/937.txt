Henri-Gustave Casadesus (30 September 1879, Paris – 31 May 1947, Paris) was a violist , viola d'amore player, and music publisher. Casadesus received his early musical instruction with Albert Lavignac and studied viola with Théophile Laforge at the Conservatoire de Paris , taking first prize in 1899. From 1910 to 1917, he was the violist of the Capet Quartet .  Along with Camille Saint-Saëns , Casadesus founded the "Societé des instruments anciens" in 1901. The society, which operated between 1901 and 1939, was a quintet of performers who used obsolete instruments such as the viola da gamba , or Casadesus's own instrument, the viola d'amore . The quintet was also notable in its day for premiering rediscovered works by long-dead composers. It was later discovered that Casadesus and his brothers, notably Marius Casadesus , wrote these works. The Adélaïde Concerto , allegedly by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , is sometimes mistakenly attributed to Henri but is actually by Marius. However, Henri is believed to have been the author of a "Concerto in D Major for viola" ascribed to Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach , described by Rachel W. Wade in her survey The Keyboard Concertos of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. This concerto appeared in 1911 in a Russian edition, allegedly "transcribed...for small orchestra by Maximilian Steinberg ," and was subsequently performed by conductors such as Darius Milhaud and Serge Koussevitsky , then recorded by both Felix Prohaska and Eugene Ormandy , all under the false attribution. "Thus," Wade wrote in 1981, "at the present time, the most frequently recorded concerto of C.P.E. Bach is a spurious one."  Henri is also credited with the " Handel Concerto" and the " J.C. Bach Concerto," which are both for viola as well. These are often referred to as "The Handel/Casadesus Concerto" and "The J.C. Bach/Casadesus Concerto". Scholarly criticism has confirmed that both these concerti were written by Henri Casadesus in the style of their purported composers. Casadesus is also the composer of a violin concerto in D major in the style of Boccherini  He was the brother of Marius Casadesus and Robert-Guillaume Casadesus , uncle of the famous pianist Robert Casadesus , and granduncle of Jean Casadesus . Henri Casadesus had five children including actor Christian Casadesus and actress Gisèle Casadesus . He was grandfather to Jean-Claude Casadesus and Dominique Probst .
