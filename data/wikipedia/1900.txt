Johannes Jeep , also Johann or Jepp, (1581/1582 â€“ 19 November 1644) was a German organist, choirmaster and composer. Jeep (pronounced "Yape"), who was born in Dransfeld , Germany, is remembered for his choral writing. He collected his student songs in Studentengartlein , the first volume published in 1607, the second volume in 1609, and both published as a single volume in 1614. He also published more than one hundred hymns in the Hohenlohe Hymnbook in 1629. He was one of the first German musicians to travel to Italy . In 1613, he was appointed director of music for the court of the Count of Hohenlohe , serving until 1625. Around 1635, he served as organist at Frankfurt Cathedral . In 1642, he was appointed conductor for the court of the Count of Hanau .  He died in Hanau , Germany. His best-known song is the 4-part madrigal "Musica, die ganz lieblich Kunst" ("Music, the most lovely art"). The novelist James Joyce was an accomplished tenor. In Ulysses ( Episode 16, "Eumaeus" , 663:14-22), Joyce's autobiographical character, Stephen Dedalus , performs Jeep's spirited song "Von der Sirenen Listigkeit" ("Of the Siren's Cunning") for Leopold Bloom , and the two men bond over its misogyny .
