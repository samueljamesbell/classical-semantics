Johann Rosenmüller (1619 – 10 September 1684) was a German Baroque composer, who played a part in transmitting Italian musical styles to the north. Rosenmüller was born in Oelsnitz , near Plauen .  He studied at the University of Leipzig , graduating in 1640.  He served as organist of the Nikolaikirche Leipzig from 1651, and had been assured of advancement to cantor .  He became director of music in absentia to the Altenburg court in 1654.  However, in 1655 he was involved in a scandal involving alleged homosexual activities.  To avoid prison he fled to Italy, and by 1658 was employed at Saint Mark's in Venice .  He composed many vocal works while teaching at an orphanage for girls, ( Ospedale della Pietà ) between 1678 and 1682.  The works of Giovanni Legrenzi and Arcangelo Corelli were among his Italian influences and his sacred compositions show the influence of Heinrich Schütz . In his last years, Rosenmüller returned to Germany with Duke Anton-Ulrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel , at whose court he served as choir master.  He died in Wolfenbüttel on 10 September 1684, and is buried there.
