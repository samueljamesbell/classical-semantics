Johann Friedrich Doles (23 April 1715 â€“ 8 February 1797) was a German composer and pupil of J.S. Bach . Doles was born in Steinbach-Hallenberg .  He attended the University of Leipzig . He was Kantor at the Leipzig Thomasschule , conducting the Thomanerchor from 1756 to 1789; in that year (1789) he directed the performance of Bach's motet Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied that reportedly made a deep impression on Mozart . Doles wrote a manuscript treatise on singing which may preserve some elements of Bach's own methods.
