He wrote several motets for the church and had his oratorio Esther performed at the Concert Spirituel in 1775. His first published work was the cantata Aline, reine de Golconde in 1767. He went on to compose several operas.  His son, Joseph-Nicolas Lefroid de Méreaux (1767–1838), was also a composer, mostly of piano music.  His grandson was Amédée Méreaux .
