Záviš ze Zap (c. 1350 in Zápy – c. 1411) was a Czech theologian and composer . He received a Baccalaureate from Charles University in Prague in 1379, and became a professor there in 1391. He also studied laws in Rome and Padua .  From 1394 to 1402 he was a canon in Olomouc , then taught again in Prague . The last time he is mentioned is in 1411 as a doctor of theology. One of the most valuable Czech medieval songs (poems) is attributed to him. It is called Jižť mne všě radost ostává (sometimes also called Záviš's song )  and it follows the text of the song Alle Freude verlässt mich by German minnesinger Frauenlob . His sacred works were influenced by the Marian cult of the Late Middle Ages . His compositions were based on melodies of some older liturgical works, kept in the archive of the St Vitus Cathedral in Prague. He is also credited with the authorship of several Latin liturgical tropes: It is also possible that he wrote another Latin liturgical hymn, Gloria Clemencia, pax, baiula .
