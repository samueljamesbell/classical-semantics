Pierre Gabaye (1930-2000) was a French composer . His musical tuition began at age seven on the piano , and which led him to pursue a career as a pianist and composer in both the classical and jazz spheres. He studied the piano with Simone Plé-Caussade at the Conservatoire de Paris . He won the 1956 Prix de Rome ,  and was later appointed Director of Light Music at Radio France .  He retired in 1986 and moved to Chamonix . Gabaye's compositional style can be described as a late exemplar of the French neo-classical tradition, in the mould of Poulenc and Saint-Saëns .  A lot of his music is light-hearted, and written for brass and wind instruments.
