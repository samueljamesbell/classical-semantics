Hans Gerle (c.1500, Nuremberg - 1570, Nuremberg) was a German lutenist and arranger of the Renaissance . Little concrete information is available regarding Gerle's life. His father was probably Conrad Gerle (died 1521), one of the city's better-known lute makers. Gerle likely spent his entire life in Nuremberg. Gerle published three volumes of lute music through Hieronymus Formschneider , a Nuremberg publisher. The first two were issued in 1532-33, and the last in 1552; this third volume refers to Gerle as "the elder" on the title page, so it is presumed that Gerle had either a son or another relative with the same name. The first publication contains an introduction to the performance of lute, viola da gamba ( Grossgeigen ), and rebec ( Kleingeigen ), as well as an explanation of musical notation , and is a significant source of information on performance practice . The book is primarily made up of intabulations of German composers such as Ludwig Senfl , Johann Walter , Heinrich Isaac , Thomas Stoltzer , and Paul Hofhaimer . His second volume, for solo lute, features works from many older composers, such as Hayne van Ghizeghem , Josquin des Prez , Isaac, and Jacob Obrecht , as well as popular contemporaries such as Claudin de Sermisy , Adrian Willaert , Jean Mouton , and Senfl. The third volume was a transcription into German tablature of pieces previously only available in Italian tablature, including works of Giovanni Maria da Crema , Domenico Bianchini , Simon Gintzler , Francesco Canova da Milano , Pietro Paolo Borrono , and Alberto da Ripa .
