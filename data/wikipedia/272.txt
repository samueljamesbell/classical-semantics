Marianna Auenbrugger (19 July 1759 in Vienna â€“ 25 August 1782) was an Austrian pianist and composer . The daughter of the physician Leopold Auenbrugger , she was a highly regarded pianist and composer in Vienna. Together with her sister Caterina Franziska, she was a student of Joseph Haydn and Antonio Salieri . In 1780 Haydn dedicated a cycle of six sonatas to the two sisters (Hob XVI :35-39 and 20). When Marianne died in 1782, Salieri, at his own expense, published her Keyboard Sonata in E-flat together with his own funeral Ode 'De si piacevoli'.
