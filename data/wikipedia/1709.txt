Alexei Vasilievich Haieff (August 25, 1914 – March 1, 1994)  was an American composer of orchestral and choral works.  He is known for following Stravinsky's neoclassicism , observing an austere economy of means, and achieving modernistic effects by a display of rhythmic agitation, often with jazzy undertones. Born in Blagoveshchensk , in the Russian Far East , Haieff received his primary education at Harbin , Manchuria .  In 1931 he went to the U.S., where he studied with Rubin Goldmark and Frederick Jacobi at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City (1934–38). In 1938-39 he also studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris and in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He became a U.S. citizen and held U.S. citizenship for 55 years, until his death. He held a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1946 and again in 1949 , and was a Fellow at the American Academy in Rome (1947–48). His Divertimento (1944) was choreographed by George Balanchine in 1947. He won the Rome Prize in 1949. He was a professor at the University at Buffalo (1962–68), and composer-in-residence at the University of Utah (1968–70). His Piano Concerto won the New York Music Critics ’ Circle Award (1952) and his 2nd Symphony the American International Music Fund Award (1957).  Haieff's notable students include Paul Ramsier .
