Martinus Fabri (died May 1400) was a North Netherlandish composer of the late 14th century. Fabri was probably either from Flanders or the Netherlands , and lived near the end of the Middle Ages . The surname "Fabri" was probably a Latinization of a name like Smit , Smeets or perhaps Le Fèvre (all meaning "smith") ( Wegman 1992 , 192). Little is known about his life. Apart from an undated mention of his name in the records of the church of St Donatian, Bruges , he is known to have been a singer at the court of Holland at The Hague from 1395 until his death in May 1400 ( Reaney 2001 ). Of the three singers known to have been at the court in this time period, he was the only one known to have had a university degree ( Wegman 1992 , 193). After his demise, several books of polyphonic music were bought from his estate by the Count of Holland for use in his chapel ( Reaney 2001 ). Of his compositions, only four complete pieces survive, all ballades . Two of these have French texts ( Or se depart and N'ay je cause d’estre lies et joyeux ) and are in the ars subtilior style, highly complex and mannered ( Reaney 2001 ). Both are three-voice compositions, though there are two (incompatible) alternatives for the third voice in Or se depart —a triplum and a contratenor ( Reaney 2001 ). The other two ballades are in Dutch ( Eer ende lof heb d'aventuer and Een cleyn parabel ), with a simpler syllabic style of setting ( Reaney 2001 ). The Leiden manuscript in which all of Fabri's works are found also contains an incomplete ballade, Een cleyn parabel , the text of which describes a dilemma: the poet loves his lady and would like to marry her, but finds it difficult to accept her recently born child. This may be an autobiographical reference: Martinus Fabri had a son baptized in April 1396, and the godmother was Margaret of Cleves, Countess of Holland ( Wegman 1992 , 194).
