Ananias Davisson (February 2, 1780 â€“ October 21, 1857) was a singing school teacher, printer and compiler of shape note tunebooks. Davisson was born February 2, 1780 in Shenandoah County, Virginia . He spent his last years living on a farm at Weyer's Cave , about 14 miles from Dayton, Virginia , and died October 21, 1857. He is buried in the Massanutten-Cross Keys Cemetery, Rockingham County, Virginia . Davisson was a member and ruling elder of the Presbyterian Church. He is best known for his 1816 compilation the Kentucky Harmony (Harrisonburg, Virginia), which is generally considered the first Southern shape-note tunebook. Composer and publisher William B. Blake said it was "a book characteristic of that period, abounding in minor tunes." Other books published by Davisson were A Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony (Harrisonburg, Virginia: 1820), Introduction to Sacred Music, Extracted from the Kentucky Harmony and Chiefly Intended for the Benefit of Young Scholars , (Harrisonburg, Virginia: 1821), and A Small Collection of Sacred Music (Harrisonburg, Virginia: 1825). According to musicologist George Pullen Jackson , Davisson's compilations are "pioneer repositories of a sort of song that the rural South really liked." Perhaps his best-known tune is "Idumea," a minor tune very popular in Southern shape note circles and featured in the movie Cold Mountain . In addition to his own tunebooks, Davisson also printed Songs of Zion by James P. Carrell (1821)
