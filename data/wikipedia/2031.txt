Franz Krenn (26 February 1816 – 18 June 1897) was an Austrian composer and composition teacher born in Droß . He studied under Ignaz von Seyfried in Vienna,  and served as organist in a number of Viennese churches, becoming Kapellmeister of St. Michael's Church in Vienna in 1862.  From 1869 until 1893 Krenn taught harmony , counterpoint and composition at the Vienna Conservatory . During this time, he appears to have acquired the nickname 'Old Krenn', and is today often described as having been a rather pedantic teacher.  Among his well-known pupils are Leoš Janáček , Mathilde Kralik , Gustav Mahler , who studied with him between 1875 and 1878, Richard Robert , Hans Rott , and Alexander von Zemlinsky .
