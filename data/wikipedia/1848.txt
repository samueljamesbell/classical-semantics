Hurlstone studied piano and composition at the Royal College of Music , after gaining a scholarship by writing a Trio for Clarinet, Bassoon and Piano, performed at his local church. His piano professors were Algernon Ashton and Edward Dannreuther .  His composition teacher, Sir Charles Villiers Stanford , considered Hurlstone to have been the most talented of the many brilliant students he taught. Those also included Frank Bridge, John Ireland and Coleridge-Taylor.  In 1904 he was highly commended for Variations on a Swedish Air, performed at the first Patron's Concert. In 1905 he won first prize in the Cobbett competition for a single-movement String Quartet. One of his former teachers, Walford Davies, appointed him accompanist to the Bach Choir. In 1906, Hurlstone returned to the college as Professor of Counterpoint, but died later that year of bronchial asthma, from which he had suffered all his life.
