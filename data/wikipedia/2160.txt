Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne or Moyne (3 April 1751 – 30 December 1796) was a French composer, chiefly of operas . Born in Eymet , Dordogne , he first worked as a musician in Berlin and Warsaw , where in 1775 he produced his first opera, Le bouquet de Colette , starring his pupil Antoinette de Saint-Huberty (née Clavel). He returned to France and wrote the tragic opera Électre , which received its premiere in 1782. Lemoyne claimed his music was following the example of Christoph Willibald von Gluck , then the greatest influence on French opera, but when Électre failed Gluck rejected any association with the younger composer. Lemoyne turned to Gluck's rivals, Niccolò Piccinni and Antonio Sacchini , as musical models for his next two tragedies, Phèdre (1786) and the Egyptian-set Nephté (1789), which had more success. His later operas are less important. He died in Paris.
