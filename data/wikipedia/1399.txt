Hermann Finck (21 March 1527 â€“ 28 December 1558) was a German composer . The great-nephew of composer Heinrich Finck , Hermann was born in Pirna , and died at Wittenberg . After 1553 he lived at Wittenberg, where he was organist , and there, in 1555, was published his collection of wedding songs . Few details of his life have been preserved. His theoretical writing was good, particularly his observations on the art of singing and of making ornamentations in song. His most celebrated work is entitled Practica musica, exempla variorum signorum, proportionum, et canonum, judicium de tonis ac quaedam de arte suaviter et artificiose cantandi continens (Wittenberg, 1556). It is of great historic value, but very rare.
