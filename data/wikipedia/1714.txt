Bengt Hambraeus (b. Stockholm , Sweden , January 29, 1928; d. Glen Roy, Ontario, (in Glengarry County), near Montreal , Quebec , Canada, September 21, 2000) was a Swedish-Canadian organist, composer and musicologist.  Hambreaus studied organ with Alf Linder and musicology with Carl-Allan Moberg, earning his doctorate in 1956 on a thesis about medieval musical notation. From 1957 to 1972 he worked at the music department of the Swedish Radio , eventually holding executive and producer posts, and during this time became a very high-profile emissary of new music in Sweden, encouraging discussion of new musical forms, a renewal of organ music with new tonal/technical concepts and the integration of performance art , improvisation , live electronics and stereo/spatial effects into traditional concert performing. He was also a prolific composer. In 1972 he became professor of composition at McGill University , Montreal and he remained in Canada until his death in 2000. Among his notable pupils are composer Peter Allen and pianist Richard Hunt . He was elected into the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 1967 and received the Swedish Royal Medal Litteris et Artibus in 1986. Hambraeus wrote music for a large number of instruments, but he is perhaps best known for his organ works. Together with Mauricio Kagel and Gy√∂rgy Ligeti he was among the first to use high modernist compositional methods to compose organ music. Limelight Records released his Constellations and Interferences on LP.
