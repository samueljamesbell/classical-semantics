Jules Van Nuffel (1883 â€“ 1953) was a Belgian priest, musicologist , composer , and a renowned expert on religious music . Born on 21 March 1883 in Hemiksem, Belgium , Van Nuffel studied at the Grand Seminary of Mechelen for the priesthood , in addition to piano , violin , organ , harmony and counterpoint . He was ordained priest  by Cardinal Mercier on 25 May 1907.   As a cantor at Mechelen Cathedral , he founded the cathedral choir, and directed it until 1949. In this connection, he collaborated with the organist at the cathedral, the renowned Flor Peeters . Also, from 1918 until his death (in Wilrijk, Belgium ), on 25 June 1953, Van Nuffel directed the Lemmens Institute in Leuven .  . A nationally prominent composer of liturgical works (though little known outside his native land),  Van Nuffel numbered among his favorite composers Bach , Wagner and Debussy . The numbering of the psalms, which he composed for the liturgy, follows the Latin Psalter . One of his crowning achievements was the creation of the Nova Organi Harmonia . This was an eight-volume collection of Gregorian accompaniments, composed by Van Nuffel himself, along with Peeters, Jules Vyverman , Marinus de Jong , and other professors at the Lemmens Institute. The Nova Organi Harmonia was reprinted in many editions after World War II .
