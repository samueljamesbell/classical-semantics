Francesco Cellavenia (fl. c. 1538 – 1563) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance , active in Casale Monferrato . Little is known about his life, and the few details once thought secure are contested.  He may have been from Cilavegna , a town near Pavia , judging by his name, and he likely spent a large portion of his career in Casale Monferrato, a town in northwestern Italy .  He may have been maestro di cappella at the cathedral there, or perhaps held a similar post at S Maria di Piazza.  The cathedral in Casale Monferrato possesses several important manuscripts which contain the surviving work by Cellavenia. One of the manuscripts, Casale Monferrato, Duomo, Archivio Capitolare, D (F) , includes seven compositions by Cellavenia out of a total of sixty-six compositions, mostly motets (other composers with works in the collection include Jean Mouton , Jean Richafort , Jacquet of Mantua , Cristóbal de Morales , and others). Another manuscript, I-CMac (N)(H) , has four motets by Cellavenia. Both were copied in the period from 1538 to 1545.  Cellavenia's music shows a mixture of Italian elements and stylistic traits of the Franco-Flemish composers from the north. Many of his motets are based on pre-existing material: canti firmi are drawn from composers such as  Richafort and Andreas da Silva , composers who are, not surprisingly, represented in the same manuscripts which contain his work – he was familiar with their music from his work at the cathedral. Others of his motets are based on Gregorian chants .  His complete works, edited by David Crawford, are in volume 80 of Corpus mensurabilis musicae (1978).
