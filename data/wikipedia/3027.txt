Friedrich Seitz (12 June 1848, Günthersleben-Wechmar , Saxe-Coburg and Gotha – 22 May 1918) was a German Romantic Era composer. He was a violinist who served as a concertmaster , who wrote chamber music and eight student concertos for the violin. Seitz studied violin first under Karl Wilhelm Uhlrich in Sondershausen , Germany; he later married Uhlrich's daughter. He became a student of Johann Christoph Lauterbach in 1874. He became music director at Sondershausen, and thereafter became concertmaster at Magdeburg . In 1884 he was the " Hofkonzertmeister " (conductor of the court orchestra) at Dessau . Movements from Seitz' student concerti (No. 2 and No. 5) have become more widely known by virtue of their inclusion in the Suzuki violin method instructional material.
