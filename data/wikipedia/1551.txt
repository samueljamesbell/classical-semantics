Charles-Hubert Gervais (19 February 1671 – 14 January 1744) was a French composer of the Baroque era . The son of a valet to King Louis XIV 's brother, Monsieur , Gervais was born at the Palais Royal in Paris and probably educated by Monsieur's musical intendants, Jean Granouillet de Sablières and Charles Lalouette. He worked as a musician for the Duc de Chartres , the future regent of France. In 1701, he married Françoise du Vivier (she died in 1723). In 1721 he was named sous-maître de musique at the Chapelle royale along with André Campra , Nicolas Bernier and Michel Richard Delalande (who had previously held the post alone). Gervais composed sacred music and operas, including two tragédies en musique .
