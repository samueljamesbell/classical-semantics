Johann Lorenz Bach (20 September [ O.S. 10 September] 1695 – 14 December 1773) was a German organist and composer of the Frankish line of the Bach family . Born in Schweinfurt , Johann Lorenz Bach was musically trained by his father Johann Valentin Bach , and from 1715 to 1717 in Weimar by Johann Sebastian Bach .  From 1718 until his death he was choirmaster, organist, and schoolmaster in the Freiherrlich Lichtensteinische Residenz Lahm im Itzgrund , the court of the Freiherr in Itzgrund (near Coburg ). The organ in the church of the residenz was built in 1732 by Heinrich Herbst, an organ builder from Halberstadt, with 29 stops, two manuals and pedal. Bach played there for more than forty years. It is largely in the same condition. Bach died in Itzgrund. Except for a Prelude and Fugue in D major, works by Johann Lorenz Bach are lost. A copy of the Prelude exists in the Lahm parish archive in Itzgrund.
