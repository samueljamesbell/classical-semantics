Jani Christou ( Greek : Γιάννης Χρήστου , Giánnīs Chrī́stou; 8 or 9 January 1926 – 8 January 1970) was a Greek composer. There is some disagreement about Christou's birth, the date of which is given by some authorities as 8 January ( Lucciano 2000 , xv; Leotsakos 2001 ), while others state 9 January ( Slonimsky 1965 , 227; Stewart 1999 ). Most sources agree that he was born in Heliopolis , Egypt , though one states he was born in Alexandria ( Angermann 1994 , 14), and it has recently been reported that a birth certificate has been found stating that the composer was born in Nicosia , Cyprus, though this certificate is suspected of being a forgery ( Lucciano 2000 , xv).  His parents were Eleutherios Christou, a Greek industrialist and chocolate manufacturer, and Lilika Tavernari, of Cypriot origin ( Lucciano 2000 , xv).  He was educated at the English School in Alexandria and he took his first piano lessons from various teachers and from the important Greek pianist Gina Bachauer . In 1948 he gained an MA in philosophy after having studied with Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell in Cambridge ( Leotsakos 2001 ). During that time he also studied music with Hans Redlich and in 1949 travelled to Rome to study orchestration with Angelo Francesco Lavagnino . He briefly attended lectures by Carl Jung in Zurich . In 1951 he returned to Alexandria where he married Theresia Horemi in 1961. He died on or the day before his 44th birthday in a car accident in Athens , Greece ( Leotsakos 2001 ).
