Jean Becker (May 11, 1833 – October 10, 1884) was a prominent German violinist from Mannheim in the Grand Duchy of Baden . He studied with Aloys Kettenus and Vincenz Lachner . After a short period as a conductor at Mannheim, he entered upon a series of concert tours (1858). He finally settled in Florence, Italy , where he was the founder and first violinist of the Florentine Quartet which was famous throughout the world at the time. During his career, Becker toured extensively,  both as a solo virtuoso, and later, using a Stradivarius violin (made 1685), as a chamber music performer.  He composed some short pieces for the violin, one of which is a Gavotte known to students of the violin today who pursue the Suzuki Method . Antonín Dvořák 's "Slavonic" String Quartet No. 10 in E Flat Major Op. 51 (1879) was dedicated to him. Becker's sons also became known musicians; Hugo Becker became a renowned cellist and Hans Becker a violinist. 1.Gavotte
