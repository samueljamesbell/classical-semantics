Julius Schulhoff (Julius Šulhov) (22 August 1825 – 15 March 1898) was a Bohemian pianist and composer of Jewish birth. As a composer, he was best known for his virtuosic salon pieces for solo piano, which included a grand sonata in F minor, twelve études , and various caprices , impromptus , waltzes , and mazurkas . Schulhoff was born in Prague , where he began studying piano with Kisch and Ignaz Amadeus Tedesco and also trained in music theory with Václav Tomášek . He made his debut at Dresden in 1842 and soon afterwards appeared at the Leipzig Gewandhaus . Moving to Paris shortly afterwards, he met Frédéric Chopin , who encouraged him in his bid to become an established professional pianist. The concerts that Schulhoff gave at Chopin's suggestion were greeted with such acclaim that he embarked on a long tour through France and to London , continuing his travels through Spain (1851) and Russia (1853). After this tour he returned to Paris, where he devoted himself entirely to composition and teaching. He continued as a piano teacher when he settled in Dresden in 1870 and later moved to Berlin in 1897. He died in Berlin in 1898, aged 72. He was the great-uncle of the 20th-century composer Erwin Schulhoff . This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain : Singer, Isidore ;  et al., eds. (1901–1906).
