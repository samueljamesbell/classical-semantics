Duarte Lobo (ca. 1565 – 24 September 1646; Latinized as Eduardus Lupus ) was a Portuguese composer of the late Renaissance and early Baroque .  He was one of the most famous Portuguese composers of the time, together with Filipe de Magalhães , Manuel Cardoso , composers who all began their academic studies as students of Manuel Mendes . Along with John IV , King of Portugal, they represent the "golden age" of Portuguese polyphony . Details of his life are sparse.  He was born in Alcáçovas , in Alentejo , southern Portugal. He is known to have been a choir boy at Évora where he subsequently studied with Manuel Mendes.  His first position was as mestre de capela of the cathedral of Évora ; sometime before 1589, he became maestro di cappella at the Hospital Real, Lisbon. By 1591 he was appointed as mestre de capela at the cathedral in Lisbon , a position he held till 1639. This was the most prestigious musical appointment in the country. He also served as director of the Seminar of São Bartolomeu, and was also a professor of music at the 'Colégio do Claustro da Sé' (College at the Holy See Cloisters) in Lisbon, where he taught Manuel Machado . While chronologically his life overlapped with the beginning of the Baroque music era, he was a rather conservative composer who followed the techniques of the Renaissance masters of the previous generation. Palestrina 's polyphonic style played a crucial role in his compositions throughout his life. Free scores by Duarte Lobo in the Choral Public Domain Library (ChoralWiki)
