Jakob van Domselaer (15 April 1890 in Nijkerk , Gelderland – 5 January 1960) was a Dutch composer. Domselaer was born at Nijkerk , Netherlands .  In 1912, he traveled to Paris where he met the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian (1872–1944), eventually becoming a part of Mondrian's artistic circle known as " De Stijl ."  Domselaer's piano suite Proeven van Stijlkunst (Experiments in Artistic Style, 1913–17) represented the first attempt to apply principles of Neo-Plasticism to music, and Mondrian asserted that pieces were created under the influence of the plus-minus painting he created around the year 1915 ( Blotkamp 1994 , 159).  This austere, mathematically based music represents an important but as yet unacknowledged precedent to minimalism [ citation needed ] and has been little performed or recorded.  He died at Bergen , Netherlands . Domselaer's students have included the Dutch composers Nico Schuyt ( Wennekes 2001 ) and Simeon ten Holt ( Ramaer 2001 ). At the Berlage Concourse in 1988, the Dutch pianist Kees Wieringa was one of the prize winners, playing piano music by Domselaer. He released a recording featuring the music of Domselaer in 1994 (DO Records CD, DR 001).
