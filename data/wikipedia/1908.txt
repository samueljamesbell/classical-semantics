František Jiránek (24 July 1698 – 1778) was a Czech ( Bohemian ) Baroque composer, musician and very likely a student of Antonio Vivaldi . Jiránek was born on 24 July 1698 in Lomnice nad Popelkou (Northern Bohemia , present-day Czech Republic ). His parents were servants of the Counts of Morzin; František also started to work for them as a musician. Count Václav Morzin sent  him to Venice in 1724 to improve his musical abilities. His teacher was probably Antonio Vivaldi himself.  Count Václav Morzin was a very important supporter of Vivaldi (Vivaldi dedicated to him his famous Four Seasons ). In 1726 Jiránek came back to Prague and worked as a violinist in the Prague ensemble of Václav Morzin.  In this ensamble worked also Antonín Reichenauer and Johann Friedrich Fasch . After the death of Václav Morzin in 1737 Jiránek left Prague and was employed by the Prime Minister of Saxony , Heinrich von Brühl in Dresden . In Dresden his work was informed by the coming Classical music . After the death of Heinrich Brühl in 1763 he retired and died in 1778 in Dresden. Only Jiránek's instrumental works have been preserved (e.g. violin concertos , symphonies or concertos). His work was strongly influenced by Vivaldi's musical style, although it has also many original distinctive elements.
