Joseph Quesnel (15 November 1746 – 2 or 3 July 1809) was a French Canadian composer , poet , and playwright .  Among his works were two operas , Colas et Colinette and Lucas et Cécile ; the former is considered to be the first Canadian opera.  Quesnel was born in Saint-Malo , France , the third child of Isaac Quesnel de La Rivaudais (1712-1779), a prosperous merchant, and his wife Pélagie-Jeanne-Marguerite Duguen.  On completing his education at the Collège Saint-Louis (1766) he shipped on board a man-of-war, visiting Pondicherry and Madagascar , travelling in Africa , and after three years returned to France. After resting a few months, he set out for French Guiana , and afterward visited several islands of the Antilles and explored part of Brazil .  In 1779, he travelled to North America on a French vessel which was captured by the British . Quesnel was taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia and then Montreal, Quebec . He married Marie-Josephte Deslandes there and became partners in business with Maurice-Régis Blondeau , his mother-in-law's new husband. He died of pleurisy at Montreal in 1809 several months after he had dived into the Saint Lawrence River to save a drowning child.  Quesnel was the subject of the comic opera Le Père des amours , written by Eugène Lapierre in 1942. Quesnel's son Jules Maurice Quesnel travelled with Simon Fraser on his journey to the Pacific Ocean ; the town of Quesnel, British Columbia is named for him. Another son Frédéric-Auguste became a lawyer and politician; his daughter Mélanie married lawyer Côme-Séraphin Cherrier . Besides several songs, he composed sacred music for the parish church of Montreal, and some motets, and wrote a short treatise on the dramatic art (1805)
