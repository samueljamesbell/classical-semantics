Joseph Küffner ( Kueffner ) (31 March 1776 in Würzburg – 9 September 1856 in Würzburg)   was a German musician and composer who, among other achievements, contributed significantly to the guitar repertory, including chamber music . He was a violinist with the Würzburg court orchestra,   and was later, when Würzburg became part of Bavaria (1802), assigned to take charge of military music . At this point he became bandmaster with a Bavarian Army regiment.   A quintet of Küffner's for clarinet and strings was once attributed to Carl Maria von Weber ,  and is still recorded in collections of Weber's music.  He composed seven symphonies and a large number of works for various chamber music combinations. His output also contains a substantial quantity of music for classical guitar (some of it being available in modern editions).
