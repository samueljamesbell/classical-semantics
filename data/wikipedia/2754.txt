Marie-Anne-Catherine Quinault (26 August 1695 in Strasbourg – 1793 in Paris)  (known as l'aînée) was a French singer and composer. Her father was the actor Jean Quinault (1656–1728), and her brother was Jean-Baptiste-Maurice Quinault , a singer, composer, and actor. She made her debut at the Paris Opera in 1709 in Jean-Baptiste Lully 's Bellérophon . She remained at the opera until 1713. In 1714 she began singing at the Comédie-Française , where she remained until 1722. Quinault composed motets for the Royal Chapel at the Palace of Versailles . For one of these motets she was awarded the first Order of Saint Michael given to a woman. She was the mistress of the Duc of Orleans and may have been secretly married to the Duc of Nevers. This brought her into higher social spheres and earned her a pension on the King’s tab. She would spend 1723 - 1793 living in an apartment in the Louvre, at the Pavilion de L’Infante.
