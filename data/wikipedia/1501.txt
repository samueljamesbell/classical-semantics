Cristóbal Galán (c. 1630 – 24 September 1684) was a Spanish Baroque composer. The first record of Galán is that in 1651 he was rejected as maestro de capilla in Sigüenza because he was married.  From 1653 he was a singer and organist, then later maestro de capilla in Cagliari , Sardinia .;  then from 1656 to 1659 in Morella, Castellon . From 1660 to 1663 he worked in Madrid, in an unknown position. From 1664 to 1667 he was maestro de capilla at Segovia Cathedral , then moving to the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales , Madrid, where in 1680, five years after the death of Carlos Patiño , he became director of the capilla real. He died in Madrid . In letters written in Madrid in 1675 and 1681 to Miguel de Irízar , Galán is cited as Madrid's principal composer of sacred music, since Juan Hidalgo de Polanco was only interested in writing tonos humanos .  A generation later his style was still respected by Francisco Valls .  As with other Spanish Baroque composers, many works were lost in a fire at the royal archives. None of his music for autos sacramentales by Calderón survives. Complete edition by J.H. Baron and D.L. Heiple.
