Johann Ludwig Bach (14 February [ O.S. 4 February] 1677 – 1 May 1731) was a composer and violinist . He was born in Thal near Eisenach . At the age of 22 he moved to Meiningen eventually being appointed cantor there, and later Kapellmeister . He wrote a large amount of music and regularly oversaw performances, both at Meiningen and neighbouring courts. He was a third cousin of Johann Sebastian Bach , who made copies of several of his cantatas and performed them at Leipzig . The cantata Denn du wirst meine Seele nicht in der Hölle lassen , BWV 15, once thought to be by Johann Sebastian, and listed as BWV 15 in Wolfgang Schmieder 's catalogue of his works, is now thought to be by Johann Ludwig. Bach died in Meiningen. The earliest lists of compositions by Johann Ludwig Bach appeared in the 19th century: Johann Theodor Mosewius listed 16 of his cantatas in 1852,  and Alfred Dörffel listed 17 cantatas and the Mass in E minor, with their incipits, in Vol. 41 of the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe (1894).  The Johann-Ludwig-Bach-Verzeichnis (catalogue of compositions by Johann Ludwig Bach, abbreviated JLB) contains 39 compositions, starting, in the same sequence, with the 17 cantatas listed by Dörffel:  Further there is a sacred cantata for the second Sunday after Trinity , Kommet, es ist alles bereit , JLB deest , with a manuscript dated 1719.  Compositions that are sometimes attributed to Johann Ludwig Bach: In 1852 Denn du wirst meine Seele nicht in der Hölle lassen , JLB 21, was published as J. S. Bach's 15th cantata by the Bach-Gesellschaft .  Carus Verlag published the Kyrie-Gloria Mass (JLB 38),  the Suite in G major (JLB 20),  the motets,  and a few cantatas (JLB 5, 8 and 9).
