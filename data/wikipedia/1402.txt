Gottfried Finger (ca. 1655-6 â€“ buried 31 August 1730), also Godfrey Finger , was a Moravian Baroque composer . He was also a virtuoso on the Viol ,  and many of his compositions were for the instrument. He also wrote operas . Finger was born in Olomouc , modern-day Czech Republic , and worked for the court of James II of England before becoming a freelance composer.  The fact that Finger owned a copy of the musical score of the work Chelys by the Flemish composer Carolus Hacquart suggests that the two composers may have worked together in England.  After a contest in London to set William Congreve 's The Judgement of Paris as an opera, in which Finger came in fourth place, he left England and moved to Germany . He died in Mannheim .
