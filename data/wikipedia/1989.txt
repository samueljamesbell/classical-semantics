Josef Klička (15 December 1855, Klatovy , Czech Republic – 28 March 1937, Klatovy) was a Czech organist , violinist , composer , conductor and pedagogue . He produced several large organ compositions in the style of late romanticism; these have been recorded on CD. A graduate in organ-playing from the Conservatoire in Prague , Klička subsequently worked as organist and conductor and eventually became acting professor at his old school. This was from 1892 to 1895, as deputy for Dvořák , then in the USA. Klička's son was Václav Klička (1882–1953), a harpist. Václav also taught for some years at the Prague Conservatoire. Test1
