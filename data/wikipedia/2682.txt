Henri Constant Gabriel Pierné (16 August 1863 – 17 July 1937) was a French composer, conductor , and organist . Gabriel Pierné was born in Metz in 1863. His family moved to Paris after Metz and part of Lorraine were annexed to Germany in 1871 following the Franco-Prussian War . He studied at the Paris Conservatoire , gaining first prizes for solfège , piano, organ, counterpoint and fugue .  He won the French Prix de Rome in 1882, with his cantata Edith .  His teachers included Antoine François Marmontel , Albert Lavignac , Émile Durand , César Franck (for the organ) and Jules Massenet (for composition). He succeeded César Franck as organist at Sainte-Clotilde Basilica in Paris from 1890 to 1898.  He himself was succeeded by another distinguished Franck pupil, Charles Tournemire . Associated for many years with Édouard Colonne 's concert series, the Concerts Colonne , from 1903, Pierné became chief conductor of this series in 1910. His most notable early performance was the world premiere of Igor Stravinsky 's ballet The Firebird , at the Ballets Russes , Paris, on 25 June 1910.  He remained in the post until 1933 (when Paul Paray took over his duties). He made a few electrical recordings for Odeon Records , from 1928 to 1934, conducting the L'Orchestre Colonne, including a 1929 performance of his Ramuntcho and a 1931 performance of excerpts from his ballet Cydalise et le Chevre-pied. He died in Ploujean , Finistère , in 1937. Pierné wrote several operas and choral and symphonic pieces, as well as a good deal of chamber music.  His most famous composition is probably the oratorio La Croisade des Enfants based on the book by Marcel Schwob . Also notable are such shorter works as his March of the Little Lead Soldiers , which once enjoyed substantial popularity (not only in France) as an encore; the comparably popular Marche des petits Faunes is from his ballet Cydalise et le Chèvre-pied .  His chamber work, Introduction et variations sur une ronde populaire , for saxophone quartet is a standard in saxophone quartet repertoire. His discovery and promotion of the work of Ernest Fanelli in 1912 led to a controversy over the origins of impressionist music . He became a member of the Academie des Beaux Arts in 1925. He was made a Commandeur de la Légion d'Honneur in 1935. His tomb at Père Lachaise Cemetery has a headstone designed by sculptor Henri Bouchard . Gabriel Pierné Square in Paris is named for him.
