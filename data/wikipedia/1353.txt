Guillaume Faugues (fl. c. 1460–1475) was a French composer. Very little is known of his life, however, a significant representation of his work survives in the form of five mass settings (a large surviving repertoire for a composer of the time).  Faugues holds an important place in the history of the Parody mass because of his use of the technique, particularly in Missa Le serviteur .  Faugues was a chaplain at Ste Chapelle in Bourges in 1462–1463, and was also master of the choirboys during that year, when he almost certainly met Johannes Ockeghem , who was visiting Bourges that year, and also taught Philippe Basiron who was then a choirboy.  Faugues is mentioned by two contemporaries: Loyset Compère includes him in his motet Omnium bonorum plena (before 1474), a piece which mentions the composers Compère respected, many of them from Cambrai Cathedral.  Faugues was also praised by Johannes Tinctoris for his varietas , particularly as demonstrated in his Missa "Vinus vina vinum" . Faugues' works were widely admired during his most active period, and he may have had a strong influence on the works of Johannes Martini .
