Wladimir Rudolfowitsch Vogel (b. 17 February/29 February 1896 in Moscow ; d. 19 June 1984 in Zurich ) was a Swiss composer of German and Russian extraction. Vogel first studied composition in Moscow with Scriabin , then between 1918 and 1924 with Heinz Tiessen and Ferruccio Busoni in Berlin , where he subsequently taught (1929–33) at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory . He was close to the expressionist circle around Herwarth Walden and was active (together with George Antheil , Hanns Eisler , Philipp Jarnach , Stefan Wolpe , and Kurt Weill ) in the music section of the November Group of Max Butting and Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt . In 1933, branded a “ degenerate artist ” by the Nazi regime, he left Germany and went to Strasbourg , Brussels , Paris , and London . He first turned to twelve-tone technique with his Violin Concerto in 1937. From 1939 he lived in Switzerland, at first in Ascona and from 1964 in Zürich. Until he became a Swiss citizen in 1954, he was not allowed to work in Switzerland, and relied on the support of wealthy patrons and his wife, the writer Aline Valangin . During this time, he taught composition privately, was active in the ISCM, participated in Hermann Scherchen ’s ‘Sessions d’études musicales et dramatiques’ in Strasbourg, and organized the International Twelve-Tone Music pre-conference in Osilina in 1949. His students include Erik Bergman , Tauno Marttinen , Maurice Karkoff , Rodolfo Holzmann , Robert Suter , Einojuhani Rautavaara , and Rolf Liebermann .

Vogel composed a symphony , pieces for orchestra, string orchestra, wind ensemble, a concerto for violin and another for cello, works for choir, soloists and orchestra—the most important of which, called "drama-oratorios", are based on a synthesis of speech and song—and chamber-music works.
