Most of his compositions are keyboard works in a similar galant style to his father's, with homophonic textures and clear song -like melodies . His concertos for harpsichord or piano anticipate the Viennese classical concerto, and share common features with his contemporary C. P. E. Bach . Many of his works were popular in their own time, as demonstrated by their inclusion in several 18th-century collections. Published in Frankfurt: Several more have been lost.
