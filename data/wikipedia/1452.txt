Carlo Franchi (sometimes given as de Franchi, de Franchis or de Franco, circa 1743 â€“ d. after 1779) was an Italian opera composer known for his opere buffe . He belonged to the Neapolitan school of composers and it is likely that he was born in or near Naples , where his first opera La vedova capricciosa had its premiere in 1765. Subsequent works were performed in Rome , Venice , Mantua , Turin , Florence , and outside Italy in places such as Dresden and Lisbon . His intermezzo Il barone di Rocca Antica (Rome, 1771), written jointly with Pasquale Anfossi , was influential in the development of opera buffa .
