Nikolay Alexandrovich Sokolov ( Russian : Никола́й Алекса́ндрович Соколо́в ; 26 March [ O.S. 14 March] 1859 – 27 March 1922) was a Russian composer of classical music and a member of the circle that grew around the publisher Mitrofan Belyayev . Sokolov was born in Saint Petersburg in 1859.  A student of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov , he taught Alexander Tcherepnin , Dmitri Shostakovich and Yuri Shaporin  at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory . He was the posthumous dedicatee of Shostakovich's Theme and Variations in B-flat major for orchestra , Op. 3.   Sokolov's recorded works include his contributions to several collaborative projects of the "Belyayev circle", including the set of character pieces for string quartet known as Les Vendredis as well as a set of variations for piano and orchestra on a Russian theme. Other works include a Quintet, Op. 3, also arranged for string orchestra as a serenade; final chorus from Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy 's Don Juan , Op. 5; choruses for women's voices, Op. 12 (published 1892);  piano variations, Op. 25; Variations on a popular Russian theme for string quartet (published 1899). There are also three string quartets , in F major, A major and D minor, and a string trio in D minor, his Op. 45 (published in 1916).  All of these were published by Belyayev's firm. It is possible that, when Sergei Diaghilev was looking for a composer for The Firebird , Sokolov was considered before Igor Stravinsky was settled on.   He died in Petrograd in 1922, aged 63.
