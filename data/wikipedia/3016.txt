Anton Schweitzer (6 June 1735 in Coburg – 23 November 1787 in Gotha ) was a German composer of operas , who was affiliated with Abel Seyler 's theatrical company . He was a child prodigy who obtained the patronage of the duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen , who sent him to study with Jakob Friedrich Kleinknecht at the court of Bayreuth in 1758, and then sent him to Italy (1764–66), and made him Kapellmeister . With the dismissal of the court orchestra at Hildburghausen , he was enabled to tour Europe with the Seyler theatrical company from 1769. His most notable work is the opera Alceste (1773), with a German libretto by Christoph Martin Wieland , among the early German-language operas.
