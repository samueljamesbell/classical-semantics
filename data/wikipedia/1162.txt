Josef Dessauer (28 May 1798 in Prague – 8 July 1876 in Mödling , near Vienna ), was an Austrian -born composer who wrote many popular songs, and also some less successful operas. Dessauer was born into a wealthy Jewish family, and studied piano in Prague with Bedřich Diviš Weber and composition with Wenzel Tomaschek . Dessauer began as a song composer, but later began composing operas, of which very few were performed. In 1821 he settled in Vienna, from which he made many European tours. He was a friend of many composers of his time, such as Gioachino Rossini , Franz Schubert , Hector Berlioz , Felix Mendelssohn , Franz Liszt and Frédéric Chopin , who dedicated some pieces to him.
