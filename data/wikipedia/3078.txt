František Jan Škroup (3 June 1801 in Osice near Hradec Králové – 7 February 1862 in Rotterdam ; Czech pronunciation: [ˈfraɲcɪʃɛk ˈjan ˈʃkroup] ) was a Czech composer and conductor. His brother Jan Nepomuk Škroup was also a successful composer and his father, Dominik Škroup, and other brother Ignác Škroup were lesser known composers. At the age of eleven he moved to Prague where he supported himself as a choir boy and flautist. He continued his schooling at one of the most important Czech national revival movement centres, Hradec Králové , where he was a choirboy at the cathedral. While there he studied with the local choirmaster and composer Franz Volkert  (1767–1831). He later moved back to Prague to study at the university. He became a fairly successful opera and singspiel composer producing more than a dozen stage works. Among Škroup's part-time jobs was organist at the "Temple of the Israelite Society for Regulated Worship," known since the late nineteen-forties as the "Spanish synagogue." His last position was as the musical director of the German opera in Dutch Rotterdam. He died there and, as a person without means, was buried in a mass grave. He also produced an oratorio, a mass, and a few other sacred works. He is best remembered today as the author of the melody for the Czech national anthem " Kde domov můj? " . From 1827 Škroup was a conductor at the Estates Theatre in Prague.  There he led the Czech premières of many famous works by composers such as Richard Wagner .  Škroup's oeuvre consists mainly of Czech and German opera which gained significant local popularity. Opera, Singspiel and Incidental Music Orchestral Chamber music Piano Vocal
