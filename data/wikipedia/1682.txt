Francisco Guerrero Marín (July 7, 1951 – October 19, 1997) was a Spanish composer.  He was born in Linares and died in Madrid . During his lifetime, he completed several compositions, among which there are five major works for orchestra: Antar Atman (1980), Ariadna (1984), Sahara (1991), Oleada (1993) and Coma Berenices (1997).  In 1981, he started working on the cycle Zayin on request by the Arditti Quartet . Another project was an orchestration of the piano cycle Iberia of the Spanish composer Isaac Albéniz . However, this work remained unfinished. The main aspect in Guerrero's work was the search for musical elements to match natural phenomena. In the scope of his musical work, he studied physical and mathematical principles, most notably the fractal geometry of Benoît Mandelbrot .
