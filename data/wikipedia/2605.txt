An incomplete works list (elaborated by Joel Valkila): According to a biography on a June 1926 Gramophone article , Palmgren had written two operas at that time, one produced (Daniel Hjort) and another one unproduced. As far as it is known, Palmgren never produced the other one. A detailed works list in preparation (in Finnish) can be found here: Preliminary List of Compositions by Selim Palmgren.
