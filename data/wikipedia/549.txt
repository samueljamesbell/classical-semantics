Nicolas Bernier (28 June 1664 – 5 September 1734) was a French Baroque composer. He was born in Mantes-sur-Seine (now Mantes-la-Jolie ), the son of Rémy Bernier and Marguerite Bauly. He studied with Antonio Caldara and is known for an Italian-influenced style. After Marc-Antoine Charpentier he is probably the most Italian-influenced French composer of this era, and replaced Charpentier as maître de musique des enfants (master of choristers) at the royal Sainte-Chapelle in 1704. He died in Paris .
