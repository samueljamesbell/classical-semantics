Lorenz Lemlin (also: Laurentius Lemlin ; ca. 1495 – ca. 1549) was a German composer of the Renaissance . Lemlin studied in Heidelberg , and was a singer and later Kapellmeister of the Hofkantorei there. Among his pupils was Georg Forster , who published many of Lemlin's lieder in his collection Frische teutsche Liedlein, as well as Jobst von Brandt , Caspar Othmayr , and Stefan Zirler . Another of Lemlin's works is: Der Gutzgauch auf dem Zaune saß. Translated from the German Wikipedia
