Alexander Aleksandrovich Alyabyev ( Russian : Алекса́ндр Алекса́ндрович Аля́бьев ; 15 August [ O.S. 4 August] 1787 – 6 March [ O.S. 22 February] 1851), also rendered as Alabiev or Alabieff , was a Russian composer known as one of the fathers of the Russian art song . He wrote seven operas, twenty musical comedies, a symphony, three string quartets, more than 200 songs, and many other pieces. Born to a wealthy family in Tobolsk in Siberia , Alyabyev learned music in his early years. He joined the Russian Army in 1812, during the Napoleonic War , and fought as an officer until 1823. He participated in the entry of the Russian forces into Dresden and Paris ,  and he won two awards. After the mysterious death of a man he spent all night gambling with in February 1825, he was arrested on a charge of murder.  While the evidence was not conclusive, Tsar Nicholas I expressly ordered him into exile to his native town of Tobolsk.  Freed in 1831, he spent some years in the Caucasus before returning to Moscow , where he died in 1851.  Alyabyev's most famous work is The Nightingale (Соловей), a song based on a poem by Anton Delvig . It was composed while Alyabyev was in prison, in 1825. It has entered Russian consciousness as akin to a folk song. The song became more widely known after having been introduced into Rosina's singing lesson scene in Gioachino Rossini 's The Barber of Seville by Pauline Viardot , followed by Adelina Patti and Marcella Sembrich . Mikhail Glinka wrote piano variations based on the song, as did Mily Balakirev .  Franz Liszt also wrote a transcription of it ( S. 250/1 ). It was one of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky 's favourite songs from his earliest childhood, as his mother often sang it to him.
