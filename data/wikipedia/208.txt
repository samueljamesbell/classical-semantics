Julián Arcas (1832 – 16 February 1882) was a Spanish classical guitarist and composer, who influenced Francisco Tárrega and Antonio de Torres . Arcas was born in María , Almería, and died in Antequera , Malaga. From 1860 until 1872, he performed all over Europe. The young Francisco Tárrega listened to him in 1863 in Castellón and played for him after the performance, on the request of Tárrega's father. Arcas then invited Tárrega to study with him in Barcelona. Arcas wrote fifty-two original works and transcribed thirty pieces for the guitar, including waltzes, variations , preludes and dances. Thirty were published in Barcelona by Vidal y Roger and fifty in Madrid by Unión Musical Española. Through the work of the guitar maker Antonio de Torres Jurado , Arcas influenced the development of the classical guitar, particularly with regard to the design of the soundboard .
