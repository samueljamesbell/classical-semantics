Gilbert Banester ( c. 1445 â€“ 1487) was an English composer. Possibly a native of London , he was Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal from 1478 to 1490.  His works are found in a number of Tudor manuscript collections of church music, including the Pepys Manuscript ; there is also an antiphon by his hand in the Eton Choirbook . Stylistically the work is similar to those of William Horwood in the same book, but is unusual in that it is written to a prose text. Two poems have been ascribed to Banester, the Miracle of St Thomas of 1467 and a translation of Boccaccio , dating to 1450, that is the first known in the English language . Little else is known of Banester's life; he is recorded as the "king's servant" in 1471. In addition, it is known that Edward IV provided him with corrodies for two Abbeys, and he was made a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1475. In 1478 he became master of the choristers. He died in 1487.
