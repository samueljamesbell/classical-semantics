Arthur De Greef (10 October 1862 – 29 August 1940) was a Belgian pianist and composer . Born in Louvain , he won first prize in a local music competition when he was only 11, and subsequently enrolled at the Brussels Conservatoire. His main teacher there was Louis Brassin , a former pupil of Ignaz Moscheles , although he also took lessons from other staffers at the institution, including Joseph Dupont , François-Auguste Gevaert and Fernand Kufferath .  After graduating with high distinction from the Conservatoire at the age of 17, De Greef went to Weimar to complete his studies under Franz Liszt . He was a Liszt pupil for two years.  Following the Weimar sojourn, De Greef embarked on a career as a concert pianist, travelling widely. He was a friend of Edvard Grieg , whose Piano Concerto he had played publicly in 1898, and who called him "the best performer of my music I have met with". In addition, he enjoyed the endorsement of Camille Saint-Saëns . British critic Jonathan Woolf has written: "De Greef was, in all respects, an intensely musical, non-sensationalist, eloquent and impressive musician and whilst not being averse to some of the interventionist tactics of his contemporaries (retouching of the score) remained sympathetically self-effacing".  De Greef composed a sizeable quantity of music, virtually all of which is now unheard. Among his works are two piano concertos . He was a devoted teacher, and taught piano at the Brussels Conservatoire for many years.  His was the first complete recording of Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor , but he had earlier recorded a cut version.  He also recorded with Isolde Menges .  Other recorded works included Liszt : Chopin Schubert Moszkowski A complete discography can be found Earthlink here .
