Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmerman (17 March 1785 – 29 October 1853), known as Pierre Zimmermann and Joseph Zimmermann , was a French pianist, composer, and music teacher. Zimmerman was born in Paris , the son of a piano maker.  He attended the Paris Conservatory in 1798, studying piano with François-Adrien Boieldieu ; while a student there, he won first prizes for piano in 1800 ( Friedrich Kalkbrenner came second)  and harmony in 1802. He would later study under Luigi Cherubini . Zimmerman became a piano assistant at the Conservatory in 1811 and a full professor there in 1816, serving until 1848; he refused a position as a professor of counterpoint and fugue in 1821. Among his students were Charles Gounod (who married one of his daughters),  Georges Bizet , César Franck , Charles-Valentin Alkan , Ambroise Thomas , Louis Lacombe , Alexandre Goria and Lefébure-Wély . In 1842 he denied Conservatory admission to 13-year old Louis Moreau Gottschalk without an audition on account of Gottschalk's American nationality, commenting that "America is a country of steam engines".  Zimmerman was often assisted in his teaching by Gounod. Zimmerman wrote two operas, L'enlèvement ( Opéra-Comique , 1830) and Nausicaa (never staged). He also composed two piano concertos , one piano sonata , and numerous other works for piano. His most important legacy is considered his Encyclopédie du pianiste , a complete method of piano playing, including a treatise on harmony and counterpoint.  He died in Paris and is buried in the Auteuil Cemetery in the 16th arrondissement .
