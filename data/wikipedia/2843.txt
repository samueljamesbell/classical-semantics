Johann Christian Heinrich Rinck (18 February 1770 – 23 July 1846) was a German composer and organist of the late classical and early romantic eras. Rinck was born in Elgersburg (in present-day Thuringia ), and died in Darmstadt , aged 76. He studied with Johann Christian Kittel (1732–1809), (a pupil of Johann Sebastian Bach ), and eventually became Kantor at the music school in Darmstadt, where he was also a court organist from 1813. He composed prolifically, and an organ primer of his enjoyed wide popularity. Among his works is a set of Variations on ‘Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman’, Opus 90, published by Simrock in 1828.  It is based on a tune made familiar by Mozart ( K265 ) (and generally associated with the words Twinkle Twinkle Little Star ). Notable students include composer Georg Vierling .
