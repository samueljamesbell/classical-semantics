Sir William Leighton ( / ˈ l eɪ t ən / ; c. 1565–1622) was an Elizabethan composer and editor who published The Teares and Lamentatacions of a Sorrowfull Soule (1614) which comprised 55 pieces by 21 composers (among them John Bull , William Byrd , John Dowland and Martin Peerson ), including eight by himself. There is a modern edition published by Stainer and Bell and a modern facsimile. Several radio broadcasts have been made but no commercial recording has been carried out yet. The book is historically important because it has parts for an instrumental accompaniment of broken consort and introduces the term " consort song ".
