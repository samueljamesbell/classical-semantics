Hermann Zilcher (born August 18, 1881 in Frankfurt am Main; † 1 January 1948 in Würzburg) was a German composer, pianist, conductor and music teacher. He was the father of actress Eva Zilcher (1920-1994) and the conductor Heinz Reinhart Zilcher (1906-1967).Zilcher received early piano lessons from his father, the composer and piano pedagogue Paul Zilcher (1855-1943), who was known as a composer of didactic piano and chamber music. The son studied from 1897 at the Dr. Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, piano with James Kwast, counterpoint and morphology with Iwan Knorr and composition with Bernhard Scholz . At graduation he was awarded the Mozart Prize. In Frankfurt.  In 1901 he moved to Berlin, where he quickly established himself mainly as a pianist for singers and instrumentalists, with concert tours, which made him internationally known in the US and in Europe. In 1905 he returned to Frankfurt as a piano teacher at the Dr. Hoch Conservatory. In 1908 he was appointed by Felix Mottl as a piano professor and in 1916 as a composition professor at the Academy of Music in Munich.  In Munich, he worked closely with the head of the Munich Kammerspiele, Otto Falckenberg (1873-1947), for whom he wrote incidental music. In 1920 he became director of the Bavarian State Conservatory in Würzburg, and  founded in 1922, the Würzburg Mozart Festival, which soon became internationally famous. For these accomplishments Zilcher was appointed in 1924  Privy Councillor by the Bavarian government and  the University of Würzburg awarded him an honorary doctorate. In the late 1920s Hermann Zilcher founded the Würzburg Chamber Orchestra, which achieved nationwide renown. As a result, Zilcher became increasingly engaged as guest conductor of other orchestras, for example, he conducted the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, at the invitation of Wilhelm Furtwängler. At this time  Zilcher conducted works of Arnold Schönberg, Ernst Krenek and Paul Hindemith. In 1933 Hindemith joined in a concert in Würzburg under Zilcher conducting as a soloist of his Viola Concerto, Op. 36.  As the pianist of  the Zilcher Trio (with violinist Adolf Schiering and cellist Ernst Chanbley)  Zilcher  performed works of Mendelssohn in 1932.

Due to a long-standing dispute Zilcher  was deprived of the management of the Mozart Festival and the directorship of the music school in 1943.   In the final phase of World War II Zilcher  was approved to not serving on the front line, but was involved in the preparations for the Mozart Festival.  Zilcher (after an anonymous complaint) was deposed as director of the Würzburg Conservatory due to his activities in the Nazi era.  The US military administration  sentenced him to logging operations, where he injured his hands.  Due to a medical certificate, he was exempted from this work.

Hermann Zilcher is counted among the traditionalists of the 20th century and stands somewhere between late Romanticism and modernity. Alfred Einstein characterized  Zilcher as follows: "one of the greatest German composers in the semi-Brahms tradition, with a neo-romantic and semi-impressionistic tonal direction"  The musicologist Barbara Haas commented:  "Hermann Zilcher [...] can be seen as a composer of the middle; between old and new; He was a composer of moderate modernism, whose musical language evolved from the music of the 19th century, which was enriched with original personality traits. " These personality traits are reflected in a tendency to simplicity and clarity of form, in a tendency to elaborate polyphony as well, and, especially in his late work - to monothematic concentration and uniform sentiment.” There is also a preference for the "Volkston" (in the style of folk music), similar to his models of Schumann and Brahms, but which is also to be found in more modern composers like Bartok or Hindemith. Zilcher had special success in his lifetime with the oratorio Die Liebesmesse (The Love Fair) premiere 1913 in Strasbourg, with his "Deutschen Volksliederspiel" for four mixed voices and piano (1915) and with the première of his Violin Concerto No. 2 in 1942 by Furtwängler and the Berlin Philharmonic. In addition to the posthumous premiere of his last symphony. 5 the led by Eugen Jochum (... "und dennoch ...) which was well received in Hamburg in 1948. In Germany, his works were rarely performed.  until the 1990s. Zilcher music again regained broader interest, with CD releases, and an increasing number of performances. Conbtributions:
