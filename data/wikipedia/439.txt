After completing his schooling there, Bazin later taught harmony at the Conservatoire.  He was later succeeded by his own student Émile Durand .

Le voyage en Chine , which premiered at the Opéra-Comique in Paris, is his best-known composition, and continued to appear well into the 20th century. Although his many light operas were popular during his lifetime, they are rarely staged today. A handful of arias are still occasionally performed, including "Je pense à vous" from Maître Pathelin recorded by Roberto Alagna . Bazin died at age 61 while working in Paris. Sadie, Stanley (Ed.)
