Jean-Nicolas Geoffroy (1633 – 11 March 1694) was a French harpsichordist and organist .  His birthplace is unknown; he died in Perpignan . His life before 1690 is unknown; he was probably a pupil of Nicolas Lebègue and served as titular organist of the Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet church in Paris . He was considered an expert in organ building and at some point in life settled in Perpignan where he played the organ of Perpignan Cathedral ( Cathédrale Saint-Jean-Baptiste ). Geoffroy's harpsichord oeuvre is, along with those of François Couperin and Jean-François Dandrieu , one of the most important contributions to French music of the Baroque era. A single collection of his pieces survives in manuscript . It contains 255 pieces and is unique for European music of the late 17th century because the pieces systematically explore all major and minor keys .
