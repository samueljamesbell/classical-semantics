Julius Klengel (24 September 1859 – 27 October 1933) was a German cellist who is most famous for his etudes and solo pieces written for the instrument. He was the brother of Paul Klengel . A member of the Gewandhaus Orchestra at fifteen, he toured extensively throughout Europe as cellist and soloist of the Gewandhaus Quartet. His pupils include Emanuel Feuermann , Gregor Piatigorsky and Alexandre Barjansky .  See: List of music students by teacher: K to M#Julius Klengel . Klengel was born in Leipzig , and studied with Emil Hegar in his youth.  His father was a lawyer and an amateur musician, and was friend of Mendelssohn .  After his 15th birthday, Klengel joined the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra where Klengel played first cello, and began touring in Europe and Russia. Klengel also became a soloist at that point, frequently giving solo performances. Klengel rose to become principal cellist of the orchestra, aged 22, in 1881.  There he remained for over four decades: to celebrate his fifty years of service, Wilhelm Furtwängler conducted a jubilee concert, in which Klengel played the cello part in a double concerto he composed for the occasion. During that time period, Klengel became professor at the Leipzig Conservatory , where he was briefly a member of Adolph Brodsky's string quartet,  and began composing. He ultimately composed hundreds of pieces for the cello, including four violoncello concertos , two double cello concertos, cello quartets, a cello sonata , as well as numerous caprices , etudes and other technical pieces. Of his music, the two volumes of etudes ("Technical Studies") for cello remain in the repertory; three concertos were recently recorded by Christoph Richter and NDR Radiophilharmonie under Bjarte Engeset . His students were Emanuel Feuermann ,   Guilhermina Suggia , Paul Grümmer , William Pleeth .  and Gregor Piatigorsky.  He died in October 1933 in his hometown of Leipzig.
