Carl Ludwig Heinrich Berger (18 April 1777 – 16 February 1839) was a German pianist , composer , and piano teacher. He was born in Berlin , and spent his youth in Templin and Frankfurt , where he studied both flute and piano . Later, he studied composition with J. A. Gürrlich in Berlin. He became friendly with the composer Clementi , and visited him in Russia , where he stayed for eight years. While in Russia, he married, but was widowed in less than a year. During the Napoleonic wars , he fled to London , where his piano performances were well received. He returned to Berlin in 1815, and lived there for the rest of his life. A nervous disorder in his arm led to the end of his career as a piano virtuoso, and he built a reputation as a teacher, numbering Mendelssohn , Taubert , Henselt , Dorn , and August Wilhelm Bach among his more distinguished pupils.

Berger wrote over 160 solo songs (for instance in 1816/17 a song-cycle "Die schöne Müllerin" based on a parlor game), as well as a piano concerto, seven piano sonatas, twenty-nine studies, and several didactic piano works. He died in Berlin in 1839.
