Angelo Tarchi (c. 1760 – 19 August 1814) was an Italian composer of numerous operas as well as sacred music . Between 1778 and 1787, he worked primarily in Italy, producing five or six new operas each year. Tarchi was born in Naples .  In December 1787 he was appointed music director and composer at London's King's Theatre , a position he held until June 1789. Tarchi returned to Italy in 1791 and remained there until 1798 when he went to Paris. He composed several works in the opéra comique genre which achieved only moderate success. When he gave up composing, he became fashionable singing teacher in Paris, where he died in 1814.
