Arturo Buzzi-Peccia (13 October 1854 – 29 August 1943) was an Italian singing instructor and song composer. Buzzi-Peccia was born 13 October 1854 in Milan , Italy, to Antonio and Clotilde Peccia.  In 1868, he was accepted at the Milan Conservatory where he studied composition under Antonio Bazzini .  In the late 1870s, he went to Paris to continue his studies under Massenet and Saint-Saëns . He returned to Italy, first to Milan and eventually taking a position in Turin as a voice teacher.  He began to write music while still in school, and composed three works to secure his diploma from the Milan Conservatory in 1875. In 1886 his Visione e Baccanale romano was performed at La Scala .  His symphonic poem Re Harfagar received critical acclaim when it premiered at La Scala in 1888.  The 1897 premiere in Turin of Buzzi-Peccia's only opera, Forza d'Amore , was conducted by Arturo Toscanini .  One of his best-known works is "Lolita: Serenata spagnola" (1892), recorded by many singers over the years including Enrico Caruso , Titta Ruffo , and Franco Corelli . His "Mal d'Amore" was sung by Joseph Schmidt in the 1934 film My Song Goes Round the World . Most of his songs were written in Italian, but he also wrote lyrics in French and English.  His most famous novelty song, " La Cigarette du Paradis " (Song of the Cigarette), was written in French.
