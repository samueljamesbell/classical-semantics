Josef Bohuslav Foerster (30 December 1859 – 29 May 1951) was a Czech composer of classical music and musicologist. He is often referred to as J. B. Foerster , and his surname is sometimes spelled Förster . Foerster was born in Prague . His ancestors were of Bohemian German ethnicity, but had assimilated into the Czech community.  The family normally lived in Prague and was musical. His father, a composer also named Josef Foerster, taught at the Conservatory . (His father's students included Franz Lehár .  ) His brother was artist Viktor Foerster .  Josef was educated accordingly, and duly studied there. He also showed an early interest in the theatre, and thought of becoming an actor. From 1884 he worked as a critic, and he would prove to be a writer of distinction. In 1893 he married the leading Czech soprano Berta Lautererová (Bertha Lauterer) in Hamburg , during ten years making his living there as a critic, and she was engaged at the Hamburg Staatsoper. In 1901 he became a teacher at the Hamburg Conservatory. In 1903 Berta went to sing at the Vienna Hofoper , and so Josef moved there with her, continuing to make a living as a music critic. He returned to Prague on the foundation of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, thereafter teaching at the conservatory and the university. In 1946 he was declared a National Composer. He died in Nový Vestec . Foerster produced numerous compositions. His music is not nationalistic in the sense of employing the idioms of Czech folk music. His work, words and music, is considered [ by whom? ] very subjective and personal, mystical and idealistic. Foerster's opera Eva is another example, like Leoš Janáček 's Jenůfa , of a libretto based on a play by Gabriela Preissová , though his treatment differs.  His compositions include five symphonies (No. 1 in D minor; No. 2 in F, Op. 29 (1892-8);  No. 3 in D, Op. 36;  No. 4 in C minor, Op. 54, "Easter Eve" (1905); and No. 5 in D minor, Op. 141 (1929)  ), other orchestral works including a symphonic poem based on Cyrano de Bergerac , much chamber music (including five string quartets (No. 1 in E, Op. 15; No. 2, Op. 39;  No. 3 in C, Op. 61; No. 4 in F, Op. 182 (1943); and the last, written 1950-1, completed by Jan Hanuš   ); three piano trios , two violin and two cello sonatas, and a several-times-recorded wind quintet ), at least five operas (notably Eva ), concertos for cello (Op. 143) and two for violin (No. 1 in C minor, Op. 88 (1911);  No. 2 in D minor, Op. 104), liturgical music, among other works, over 170 published opus numbers in all. Many of his works remember family members: the 2nd Symphony is dedicated to his sister Marie; his brother's death led to the cantata Mortuis fratribus ; his son is commemorated in the Piano Trio and the 5th Symphony; and his mother is a theme throughout his oeuvre.
