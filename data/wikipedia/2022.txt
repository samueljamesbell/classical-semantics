Kozytskiy studied at the Kiev Theological Academy from 1917 and at the Kiev Conservatory from 1920, under Boleslav Yavorsky and Reinhold Glière .  Between 1918-1924, he taught at the Lysenko Music and Drama Institute in Kiev, the Kharkiv Music and Drama Institute from 1925 to 1935, and the Kiev Conservatory.  From 1938 to 1941 he worked as artistic director for the Ukrainian State Philharmonic (during the German-Soviet war). A founding member of the Leontovych Music Society,  he was also head of the Union of Soviet Composers of Ukraine from 1952 to 1956,  and president of the Choral Society of the Ukrainian SSR from 1959 up to his death in 1960.
