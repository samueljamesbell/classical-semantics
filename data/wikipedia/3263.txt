She  graduated from the Conservatoire as an organist in 1943. She later studied at the Berlin University of Music as well.  During World War II , she met her future husband, William Duesberg, a journalist who was repeatedly imprisoned for writing stories critical of Adolf Hitler . Shortly after the war, Duesberg died of a heart attack in a Stuttgart courtroom while preparing to testify against several Nazi war criminals .  Tobias-Duesberg moved to the United States from Estonia, which was then part of the Soviet Union , in 1951.  She began composing music and performing at several churches in New York City.  She composed chamber, vocal and symphonic pieces, the most famous of which may be Requiem , which was composed for orchestra , mixed choir and soloists .

Her compositions have been performed on major concert stages in the U.S., Canada, and Europe as well as the Aspen , Ravinia and Spoleto festivals.  During a cultural backlash against classical music in the 1960s and 1970s, American conductor Leonard Bernstein described Tobias-Duesberg as a female composer who "dares to be original and musical at the same time, while all the men run around writing intellectual cacophony."  Helen Tobias-Duesberg died in Savannah, Georgia , on February 4, 2010, aged 90.
