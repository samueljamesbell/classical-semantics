Filippo de Lurano (also Luprano , or Lorano ) (c. 1475 â€“ after 1520) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance .  He was one of the most prolific composers of frottola after Marchetto Cara and Bartolomeo Tromboncino . Of his early life, almost nothing is known: the few sources we have range from attributing his birthplace to the Istrian peninsula to Lurano , which at the time was under the diocesis of Cremona, to Cremona itself.  He appears in the records of Cividale del Friuli 's Cathedral, near Udine , as a cleric. De Lurano spent time in Rome in the first decade of the 16th century, but the exact years are not known; he wrote music for a wedding of the niece of Pope Julius II in 1508.  From 1512 to 1515 he was employed as maestro de cappella of Cividale Cathedral, and shortly afterwards moved to Aquileia , where he may have died. Most of his music is in the light secular form of the frottola, an ancestor of the madrigal .  35 of his frottole survive, along with two motets and a lauda . Stylistically they are typical of the time: homophonic texture predominates, with brief imitative passages at phrase beginnings; the melodies are memorable and easily singable. One of his frottola was evidently the favorite song of Cesare Borgia , the son of Pope Alexander VI , according to a manuscript source of the time.
