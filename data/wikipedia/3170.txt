Delphin Strungk (or Strunck ) (1600 or 1601 – 12 October 1694) was a German composer and organist associated with the North German school . The first that is known of him is in 1630, when he became organist of the Marienkirche in Wolfenbüttel ; this was followed by an appointment at the court in Celle from 1632 to 1637. In May 1637, he moved to Brunswick , where he was to remain until his death, to take up the post of organist of the St. Martini church; he also played at other local churches. His surviving compositions include six pieces of church music for voices and instruments, now in the collection of the Herzog August Bibliothek , Wolfenbüttel and the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin Preussischer Kulturbesitz . There are also surviving organ works; six chorale preludes and fantasias of a high quality survive in tablature , and are now in the collection of the Ratsbücherei, Lüneburg . These have been published in Die Orgel , II/12 ( Lippstadt , 1960); Alte Meister des Orgelspiels , ed. K. Straube ( Leipzig , 1904); Seasonal Chorale Preludes with Pedals I, ed. C. H. Trevor ( London , 1963); and Corpus of Early Keyboard Music XXIII (1973). His son Nicolaus Adam Strungk was an opera composer.
