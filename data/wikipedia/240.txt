Pascual Juan Emilio Arrieta Corera (21 October 1823 â€“ 11 February 1894) was a Spanish composer. Arrieta was born in Puente la Reina , Navarre .  His Italian musical training led him, under the favour of Queen Isabel II , to concentrate on operatic writing; and though he later composed zarzuelas , he remained less committed to the renascent art form than his contemporaries such as Francisco Asenjo Barbieri , who continued to write in an essentially Italianate style throughout his life. His zarzuela Marina , one of the most popular lyric stage works in the Spanish repertoire, has been produced and recorded both on CD and DVD many times.  Arrieta died in Madrid , aged 70.
