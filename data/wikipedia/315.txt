Johann Nicolaus Bach (or Johann Nikolaus Bach ) (20 October [ O.S. 10 October] 1669 – 4 November 1753) was a German composer of the Baroque period. Johann Nicolaus was the eldest son of Johann Christoph Bach and the second cousin of Johann Sebastian Bach . He was educated at the University of Jena , where he later became organist. He was probably born at Eisenach , where his father was employed as a musician, attended the Eisenach Latin school until 1689, and was a student of the Jena city organist J.M. Knüpfer, a son of Sebastian Knüpfer ; after an Italian sojourn in 1696, he became organist at the Stadtkirche and the Kollegiatkirche in Jena.
He was influenced by Antonio Lotti . He later joined the Danish army. He then returned to Jena where he lived for the rest of his life. Few of his compositions survive. He was also a maker of harpsichords and organs. Surviving pieces include a mass, two chorale preludes on " Nun freut euch, lieben Christen g'mein " and a Singspiel Der jenaische Wein- und Bierrufer , this in the form of a quodlibet on Jena student traditions.
