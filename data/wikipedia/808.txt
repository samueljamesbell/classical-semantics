Arnold Matthias Brunckhorst (1670–1725) was a German organist and composer. He was born in Celle or Wietzendorf . Beginning in 1693, he served as an organist at St. Andreas in Hildesheim . In 1697, he assumed the organist's post at the Stadtkirche in Celle. In 1720, he was appointed court organist at Hanover . Only a few works by him have survived: two small oratorios - for Christmas and Easter, one single-movement keyboard sonata in A major (regarded as the earliest German documentation of the form of the two-part sonata structure, comparable to the formal type encountered in Domenico Scarlatti ), and a praeludium in E minor for organ. A "Präludium & Fuge" in g minor  - which was found not far ago in Berlin and was at first believed to be composed by Nikolaus Bruhns -  is now believed to be composed by Brunckhorst. However, due to at least one stylistic inconsistency in the fugue, it seems to be rather probable that - irrespective of the initial authorship of Brunckhorst or Bruhns -  this handwriting does not derive from the composer's own hand but some other, probably a scholar.
