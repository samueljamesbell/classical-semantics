Jurriaan Hendrik Andriessen (15 November 1925, Haarlem â€“ 19 August 1996, The Hague ) was a Dutch composer , whose father, Hendrik , brother Louis , and uncle Willem have also been notable composers. Andriessen studied composition with his father at the Utrecht Conservatory before moving to Paris where he studied with Olivier Messiaen . The bulk of Andriessen's output is for the stage; his study in Paris was primarily in writing film music . He had a variety of musical influences which he drew upon, including American film music, Aaron Copland 's ballets, folk music of various cultures, neoclassicism , and serialism ; this eclecticism combined with his compositional skill made his writing well-suited to scoring dramatic works. His first stage composition was incidental music for "The Miraculous Hour", a play premiered at the celebration of the 50th year of Queen Wilhelmina 's reign, in 1948. In 1954 the Haagse Comedie (now the Nationaal Toneel , or "National Theatre") appointed him resident composer, where he wrote scores for Eugene O'Neill 's Mourning Becomes Electra and Tom Stoppard 's Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead , among numerous others. His stay in the United States on a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship from 1949 to 1951 was a fruitful one for his orchestral writing, another notable area of his work; during this time he composed the Tanglewood Overture for Serge Koussevitsky , and the Berkshire Symphonies , later used as ballet music by George Balanchine . His compositions were commissioned for state celebrations, including the wedding and the coronation of Queen Beatrix and the silver jubilee of Queen Juliana . In addition to the theatre works he is most noted for, Andriessen was also a prolific composer of chamber and vocal works, many of which were meant to be performed by amateurs; he has also been a director for television.
