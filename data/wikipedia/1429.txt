Giovanni Battista Fontana (1589–1630) was an early Baroque Italian composer and violinist. Fontana was born in Brescia , and worked there and in Rome , Venice , and Padua . He died in Padua during the plague of 1629–31 . Nearly all information on Fontana comes from the preface by Fr. Giovanni Battista Reghino to his posthumously published 18 (sometimes incorrectly stated 12) [ where? ] sonatas ( Sonate a 1.2.3. per il violino, o cornetto, fagotto, chitarone, violoncino o simile altro istromento , Venice: Bartolomeo Magni, 1641). They are among the earliest sonatas of this form, consisting of six sonatas for solo violin / cornetto with continuo and 12 sonatas for one to three violins and continuo, the latter group often including a  demanding concertante part for bassoon or cello . "An atto di morte dated 7 September 1630 for a 'Zan Batta Fontana' aged 50, is the only one among the Paduan death registers of 1625–30 for a person bearing that name" ( Dunn 2014 ).
