Leo Fall (2 February 1873 – 16 September 1925) was an Austrian composer of operettas . Born in Olmütz (Olomouc), Leo (or Leopold) Fall was taught by his father Moritz Fall (1848–1922), a bandmaster and composer, who settled in Berlin . The younger Fall studied at the Vienna Conservatory before rejoining his father in Berlin. His teachers in Vienna were Robert Fuchs and Johann Nepomuk Fuchs . In 1895 he began a new career as an operetta conductor in Hamburg , and started to compose. From 1904 onwards he devoted himself to composition. While less successful than his contemporary Franz Lehár , he was nevertheless capable of producing melodious and well orchestrated work. After working in Berlin , Hamburg and Cologne he settled in Vienna in 1906, where he died. He is buried at the Vienna Zentralfriedhof . His best known operettas in the English-speaking world are The Dollar Princess and Madame Pompadour , which had successful runs in London and New York and remained in the repertory in Germany and Austria throughout the 20th century. Der liebe Augustin (1912; Princess Caprice in London) is reported to have been given an unprecedented 3,360 performances. His opera Der goldene Vogel , which was performed in Dresden in 1920 with Richard Tauber and Elisabeth Rethberg was less successful.
