Gottfried August Homilius (2 February 1714 – 2 June 1785) was a German composer , cantor and organist .  He is considered one of the most important church composers of the generation following Bach 's,  and was the main representative of the empfindsamer style. Homilius was born in Rosenthal , Saxony , the son of a Lutheran pastor, and was educated at the Annenschule in Dresden.  He then studied law at Leipzig University and the organ under Johann Sebastian Bach . From 1742 he was organist at the Dresden Frauenkirche , and from 1755 until his death cantor at the Kreuzkirche in Dresden with the associated responsibility of music director at the Kreuzkirche , the Sophienkirche , and the Frauenkirche .  After the destruction of the Kreuzkirche during the Seven Years' War he worked mainly at the Frauenkirche. Homilius predominantly composed church music : more than 10 passions (one printed in 1775; his St. Matthew Passion, particularly outstanding in the preclassical style of C.P.E. Bach and an extremely worthy successor of J.S. Bach's best-known work of the same name, has been recorded on CD), an oratorio for Christmas (1777) and one for Easter , over 60 motets , more than 150 cantatas (six arias from these appeared in 1786), chorales , preludes , and choral works.  He composed also organ music: 36 Chorale preludes for organ. His students included eminent composer Daniel Gottlob Türk . See: List of music students by teacher: G to J#Gottfried August Homilius . His vocal compositions enjoyed great popularity through the 19th century, as witnessed by the large number of copies still extant. A complete worklist and edition is in preparation at Carus Verlag ; the Homilius-Werkverzeichnis numbers (HoWV) follow the dissertation of Karl Feld and the new edition of Uwe Wolf.
