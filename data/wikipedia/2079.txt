Michel Lambert (1610 – 29 June 1696) was a French singing master, theorbist and composer. Lambert was born at Champigny-sur-Veude , France.  He received his musical education as an altar boy at the Chapel of Gaston d'Orléans. He studied also with Pierre de Nyert in Paris. Since 1636, he was known as a singing teacher. In 1641, he married singer Gabrielle Dupuis who died suddenly a year later. Their daughter Madeleine became a wife of Jean-Baptiste Lully (in 1662). After his marriage, Lambert's career became closely linked to his sister-in-law and famous singer Hilaire Dupuy (1625-1709). In 1651, he appears as a ballet dancer at the court of Louis XIV . Beginning in 1656, his reputation as a composer was established and his compositions were regularly printed by Ballard . They consist mainly of airs on the poems of Benserade and Quinault . He was the most prolific composer of tunes in the second half of the seventeenth century. In 1661, he succeeded Jean de Cambefort as a maître de musique de la chambre du roi and kept this position until his death. In 1670, he became Kapellmeister. In that time, Lully was a superintendent of the royal music. Lambert's role as a singing master and composer of dramatic airs contributed to the creation of the French opera. As a singing master, he enjoyed a reputation attested by many testimonies of his time (including singers Anne de La Barre , Pierre Perrin , and La Cerf of Viéville ). Titon du Tillet mentions concerts given in his house in Puteaux , during which Lambert himself accompanied on theorbo. He also collaborated with Lully in the creation of several ballets (e.g. Ballets des amours déguisez ). He died at Paris , France.
