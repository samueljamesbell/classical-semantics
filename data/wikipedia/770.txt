Antonio Brioschi (fl. c. 1725 â€“ 1750) was an Italian symphony composer who wrote at least twenty six symphonies ; most of which were preserved in the collection of Pierre Philibert de Blancheton .  Brioschi was a pioneer in symphonic music in the early Classical period which traditionally starts around 1730. He appears to have been a more prolific symphonic composer during this period than even the better-known Giovanni Battista Sammartini and seems to have been active in or near Milan . The symphonic school in Milan gathered around the authoritative figure of Sammartini and included Brioschi, Ferdinando Galimberti and Giovanni Battista Lampugnani . Brioschi himself seems to have been associated with the musical life of the Jewish community in Casale Monferrato .
