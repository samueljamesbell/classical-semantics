Lucile-Angélique-Dorothée-Louise Grétry (July 15, 1772 – March 1790) was a French composer. The second daughter of the famous composer André Grétry and the painter Jeanne-Marie Grandon , Lucile was trained by her father who introduced her to the court of Versailles where she made the acquaintance of Marie Antoinette . Lucile Grétry wrote two opéras comiques for the Comédie-Italienne theatre. The first, Le mariage d’Antonio (1786), was written when she was just fourteen years old. It was a sequel to her father's most famous work, Richard Coeur-de-lion (1786), and ran for 47 performances. Her father assisted her with the orchestral scoring. It was followed by Toinette et Louis in 1787, which was a failure. Lucile Grétry's marriage was an unhappy one. Her promising career was cut short by her death from tuberculosis at the age of seventeen.
