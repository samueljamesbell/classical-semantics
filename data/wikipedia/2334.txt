Filippo Marchetti (26 February 1831, Bolognola , Macerata â€“ 18 January 1902, Rome ) was an Italian opera composer .  After studying in Naples, his first opera was "successfully premiered"  in Turin in 1856. With only limited success, he became a teacher of singing and composition in Rome before composing Romeo e Giulietta for a premiere in Trieste in 1865. Overshadowed like other Italian opera composers of his period by the genius of Verdi , Marchetti achieved one great success with his 1869 opera - Ruy Blas - which was based on Victor Hugo's play, Ruy Blas . It has been noted that "it was one of the first Italian operas to show the influence of French grand opera , partly, no doubt in response to its French source".  The opera was performed into the 20th Century.
