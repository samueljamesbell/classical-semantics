Daniel Harvey was a wealthy London merchant and member of the Levant Company , his eldest brother being the anatomist William Harvey .  At school in 1640, at Hackney's "Ladies university of the female arts", she began a friendship with Katherine Philips ( the Matchless Orinda ).

Some of her music was published in John Playford 's Select Ayres and Dialogues , and three of her songs were published in Lawes' Second book of airs ; these are the first known published works by a woman in England.  On 5 April 1648 Mary Harvey married to Sir Edward Dering . They had seventeen children, seven of whom died young. She survived her husband by twenty years, dying in February 1704 (1705 New Style ); she also outlived her eldest son Sir Edward Dering, 3rd Baronet .
