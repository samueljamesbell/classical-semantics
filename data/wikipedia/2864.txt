Alexis Roland-Manuel (22 March 1891 – 1 November 1966) was a French composer and critic, remembered mainly for his criticism. He was born Roland Alexis Manuel Lévy in Paris, to a family of Belgian and Jewish origins. He studied composition under Vincent d'Indy and Albert Roussel . As a young man he befriended composer Erik Satie , who helped him to make numerous influential connections. In 1911, Satie introduced Roland-Manuel to Maurice Ravel , whose pupil, friend and biographer he soon became. In 1947, he was appointed Professor of Aesthetics at the Conservatoire de Paris , where he remained until his retirement in 1961, making many contributions to musical theory and criticism, even assisting Igor Stravinsky by ghost-writing the theoretical work "The Poetics of Music". In addition to theoretical works, he wrote and composed various works for stage, especially comic operas , and screen, developing a partnership with director Jean Grémillon , for five of whose films he composed the scores.  Roland-Manuel's criticism included several monographs on the music of Ravel from the perspective of a respectful pupil and a lifetime friend. The titles include "Ravel", "Ravel et son oeuvre" and "Ravel et son oeuvre dramatique". Arthur Honegger dedicated Pastorale d'été to Roland-Manuel.  He died in Paris in 1966.
