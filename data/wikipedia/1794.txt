Franz Hitz (17 July 1828 – 20 November 1891) was a Swiss pianist and composer who lived and worked in France. He was primarily known for his many piano compositions which were much in vogue as salon music in the latter half of the 19th century. He was born in Aarau and died in Honfleur at the age of 63. Hitz was born in Aarau , Switzerland but later settled in Honfleur , a port town in northwestern France. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire —piano with Pierre Zimmermann and Adolphe Laurent and harmony with Henri Reber —and began publishing compositions in his early 20s. One of his earliest published works was a quadrille , Les chapeaux de chez nous (The hats from home). The frontispiece had an engraving by the artist Louis Alexandre Dubourg , a friend of Hitz and a fellow resident of Honfleur.  Another early work was the patriotic anthem Retour de l'Aigle (The return of the eagle) commemorating the return of Prince Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte to France. In addition to his numerous piano works, his other compositions included a Mass with organ accompaniment and several stage works. In 1870 L'Orphéon published his elementary textbook for piano students, Questionnaire musical: Notions élémentaires .   Franz Hitz died in Honfleur at the age of 63 and was buried in the cemetery there. The following year Le Ménestrel announced that a committee had been formed to raise money for the construction of a small mausoleum for his grave.   Several of Hitz's compositions continued to be re-published into the 1920s, with some of his solo piano works such as Légende bretonne and Bonne nuit also arranged for orchestra by other composers.
