Ludwig Alois Friedrich Ritter von Köchel ( German: [ˈkœçəl] ; [Note 1] 14 January 1800 – 3 June 1877) was an Austrian musicologist , writer, composer, botanist and publisher. He is best known for cataloguing the works of Mozart and originating the 'K-numbers' by which they are known ( K for Köchel ). Born in the town of Stein , Lower Austria , he studied law in Vienna and graduated with a PhD in 1827. For fifteen years, he was tutor to the four sons of Archduke Charles of Austria . Köchel was rewarded with a knighthood [Note 2] and a generous financial settlement, permitting him to spend the rest of his life as a private scholar. Contemporary scientists were greatly impressed by his botanical researches in North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula , the United Kingdom, the North Cape , and Russia. In addition to botany, he was interested in geology and mineralogy , but also loved music, and was a member of the Mozarteum Salzburg . He died of cancer at age 77 in Vienna. In 1862 he published the Köchel catalogue , a chronological and thematic register of the works of Mozart. This catalogue was the first on such a scale and with such a level of scholarship behind it; it has since undergone revisions. Mozart's works are often referred to by their K-numbers ( cf. opus number ); for example, the "Jupiter" symphony, Symphony No. 41 K. 551. Moreover, Köchel arranged Mozart's works into twenty-four categories, which were used by Breitkopf & Härtel when they published the first complete edition of Mozart's works from 1877 to 1910, a venture partly funded by Köchel. He also catalogued the works of Johann Fux .
