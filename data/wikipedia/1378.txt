Pierre-Octave Ferroud (6 January 1900 – 17 August 1936)  was a French composer of classical music. He was born in Chasselay, Rhône , near Lyon . He went to Lyon, to Strasbourg (for military service from 1920-2) where he studied with Guy Ropartz ,  and again to Lyon where he was for a time an associate and "disciple" of Florent Schmitt , and a pupil of Georges Martin Witkowski .  He then travelled to Paris in 1923, where he later founded with Henry Barraud , Jean Rivier and Emmanuel Bondeville Triton , a contemporary music society (in 1932).  In a letter to Boris Asafiev , Sergei Prokofiev described his encounter with Ferroud, praised the Symphony in A and suggested that Asafiev might have a look at it. Ferroud's opera, he reported, impressed him much less.  He wrote a biographical work about his mentor Florent Schmitt (whom he was, nevertheless, to pre-decease - Schmitt died 31 years after Autour de Florent Schmitt was published, in 1958.) Ferroud was a regular contributor of musical reviews and essays to the journal Paris-Soir . He died in 1936, when he was decapitated in a road accident in Debrecen , in Hungary .  On hearing of Ferroud's death, Francis Poulenc wrote to Georges Auric of his distress.
