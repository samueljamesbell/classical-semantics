Elmer Bernstein (April 4, 1922 – August 18, 2004) was an American composer and conductor who is best known for his film scores. In a career that spanned more than five decades, he composed "some of the most recognizable and memorable themes in Hollywood history", including over 150 original movie scores, as well as scores for nearly 80 television productions.  Examples of his widely popular and critically acclaimed works are scores to The Magnificent Seven , The Ten Commandments , The Great Escape , To Kill a Mockingbird , Ghostbusters , The Black Cauldron , Airplane! , The Rookies , Cape Fear , Animal House , and The Age of Innocence . Bernstein won an Oscar for his score to Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967) and was nominated for 14 Oscars in total. He also won two Golden Globe Awards , an Emmy , and was nominated for two Grammy Awards . Bernstein was born to a Jewish family  in New York City, the son of Selma (née Feinstein, 1901-1991), from Ukraine , and Edward Bernstein (1896-1968), from Austria-Hungary .  Contrary to popular assumption, he was not related to the celebrated composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein , but the two men were friends.  Within the world of professional music, they were distinguished from each other by the use of the nicknames Bernstein West (Elmer) and Bernstein East (Leonard).  They also pronounced their surnames differently. Elmer pronounced his "BERN-steen", and Leonard used "BERN-stine". During his childhood, Bernstein performed professionally as a dancer and an actor, in the latter case playing the part of Caliban in The Tempest on Broadway , and he also won several prizes for his painting. He attended Manhattan's progressive Walden School and gravitated toward music at the age of twelve, at which time he was given a scholarship in piano by Henriette Michelson, a Juilliard teacher who guided him throughout his entire career as a pianist. She took him to play some of his improvisations for composer Aaron Copland , who was encouraging and selected Israel Citkowitz as a teacher for the young boy.  Elmer Bernstein's music has some stylistic similarities to Copland's music, most notably in his western scores, particularly sections of Big Jake, in the Gregory Peck film Amazing Grace and Chuck , and in his spirited score for the 1958 film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell 's novel God's Little Acre . He had a life-long enthusiasm for an even wider spectrum of the arts than his childhood interests would imply and, in 1959, when he was scoring The Story on Page One , he considered becoming a novelist and asked the film's screenwriter, Clifford Odets , to give him lessons in writing fiction. Bernstein wrote the theme songs or other music for more than 200 films and TV shows, including The Magnificent Seven , The Great Escape , The Ten Commandments (1956), True Grit , The Man with the Golden Arm , To Kill a Mockingbird , Robot Monster , and the fanfare used in the National Geographic television specials.  His theme for The Magnificent Seven is also familiar to television viewers, as it was used in commercials for Marlboro cigarettes. Bernstein also provided the score to many of the short films of Ray and Charles Eames . In 1961 Bernstein co-founded Äva Records an American record label based in Los Angeles together with Fred Astaire , Jackie Mills and Tommy Wolf. In addition to his film music, Bernstein wrote the scores for two Broadway musicals , How Now, Dow Jones , with lyricist Carolyn Leigh, in 1967 and Merlin , with lyricist Don Black , in 1983.  One of Bernstein's tunes has since gained a lasting place in U.S. college sports culture. In 1968, University of South Carolina football head coach Paul Dietzel wrote new lyrics to "Step to the Rear", from How Now, Dow Jones . The South Carolina version of the tune, " The Fighting Gamecocks Lead the Way ", has been the school's fight song ever since. Along with many in Hollywood , Bernstein faced censure during the McCarthy era of the early 1950s. Bernstein was called by the House Un-American Activities Committee when it was discovered that he had written some music reviews for a Communist newspaper. After he refused to name names, pointing out that he had never attended a Communist Party meeting, he found himself composing music for movies such as Robot Monster and Cat-Women of the Moon , a step down from his earlier Sudden Fear and Saturday's Hero .   John Landis grew up near Bernstein, and befriended him through his children. Years later, he requested that Bernstein compose the music for National Lampoon's Animal House , over the studio's objections. He explained to Bernstein that he thought that Bernstein's score, playing it straight as if the comedic Delta frat characters were actual heroes, would emphasize the comedy further. The opening theme to the movie is based upon a slight inversion of a secondary theme from Brahms 's Academic Festival Overture . Bernstein accepted the job, and it sparked a second wave in his career, where he continued to compose music for high-profile comedies such as Ghostbusters , Stripes , Airplane! and The Blues Brothers , as well as most of Landis's films for the next 15 years, including the famed music video to the Michael Jackson song " Thriller ". When Martin Scorsese announced that he was re-making Cape Fear , Bernstein adapted Bernard Herrmann 's original score to the new film . Bernstein leapt at the opportunity to work with Scorsese, as well as to pay homage to Herrmann.  Scorsese and Bernstein subsequently worked together on two more films, The Age of Innocence (1993) and Bringing Out the Dead (1999). Bernstein had previously conducted Herrmann's original unused score for Alfred Hitchcock 's 1966 Torn Curtain .  Having studied composition under Aaron Copland , Roger Sessions , and Stefan Wolpe , Bernstein also performed as a concert pianist between 1939 and 1950 and wrote numerous classical compositions, including three orchestral suites, two song cycles, various compositions for viola and piano and for solo piano, and a string quartet. As president of the Young Musicians Foundation, Bernstein became acquainted with classical guitarist Christopher Parkening and wrote a Concerto for Guitar and Orchestra, which Parkening recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra under Bernstein's baton for the Angel label in 1999. In addition, Bernstein was a professor at the University of Southern California 's Thornton School of Music and conductor of the San Fernando Valley Symphony in the early 1970s.  Over the course of his career, Bernstein won an Academy Award , an Emmy Award , and two Golden Globe Awards .  In addition, he was nominated for the Tony Award three times  and a Grammy Award five times. He received 14 Academy Award nominations and was nominated at least once per decade from the 1950s until the 2000s, but his only win was for Thoroughly Modern Millie for Best Original Music Score. Bernstein was recognized by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association with Golden Globes for his scores for To Kill a Mockingbird and Hawaii . In 1963, he won the Emmy for Excellence in Television for his score of the documentary The Making of The President 1960 . He is the recipient of Western Heritage Awards for The Magnificent Seven (1960) and The Hallelujah Trail (1965).  He received five Grammy Award nominations from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and garnered two Tony Award nominations for the Broadway musicals How Now Dow Jones and Merlin . Additional honors included Lifetime achievement awards from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), the Society for the Preservation of Film Music , the USA, Woodstock, Santa Barbara, Newport Beach and Flanders International Film Festivals and the Foundation for a Creative America. In 1996, Bernstein was honored with a star on Hollywood Boulevard .   In 1999, he received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Five Towns College in New York City and was honored by the American Film Institute in Los Angeles . Bernstein again was honored by ASCAP with its marquee Founders Award in 2001  and with the NARAS Governors Award in June 2004. His scores for The Magnificent Seven and To Kill a Mockingbird were ranked by the American Film Institute as the eighth and seventeenth greatest American film scores of all time, respectively, on the list of AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores . Bernstein, Bernard Herrmann , Max Steiner , and Jerry Goldsmith are the only composers to have two scores listed, and are therefore in second place for the most scores on the list, behind John Williams , who has three. Other Bernstein film scores nominated for the list are as follows: Bernstein was married twice, the first time to Pearl Glusman, whom he wed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , on December 21, 1946.   After the couple's divorce in 1965, Bernstein married Eve Adamson. They remained together for 39 years, until his death.  The Bernsteins in the 1990s resided in Hope Ranch , a suburb of Santa Barbara, California .  Later, they moved to a home in Ojai, California , where Elmer died from cancer on August 18, 2004, at age 82.  His publicist Cathy Mouton simply stated at the time that Bernstein had died following a lengthy illness.   He was survived by his wife Eve and their two daughters, Emilie and Elizabeth; by his two sons, Peter and Gregory Bernstein, from his earlier marriage to Pearl Glusman; and by five grandchildren.
