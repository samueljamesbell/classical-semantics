Leopold "Leo" Smit (14 May 1900 â€“ 30 April 1943) was a Dutch composer , murdered during The Holocaust at the Sobibor extermination camp .   He was born at Plantage Kerklaan ( nl ) 17, Amsterdam , and studied piano at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam with Sem Dresden and Ulfert Schults and then composition with Bernard Zweers and Sem Dresden. In 1927 he moved to Paris , where the music of Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky made a deep impression on him. Here he was in close contact with the group of composers known as Les Six , which included Darius Milhaud , Arthur Honegger , and Francis Poulenc . He married Lien de Vries in Amsterdam in January 1933. At the end of 1936, Smith moved to Brussels , where he stayed for a year. In late 1937, he returned to Amsterdam, where he completed his last work, the sonata for flute and piano, on February 12, 1943. On April 27, 1943 he was deported to Sobibor , where he was killed three days later. After his death there was for a time little interest in his music, but since the late 1980s, his work has been performed regularly. A 4-CD box set containing his complete works, Kamermuziek en Orkestwerken (NM 93003) has been issued.
