Jacques de Saint-Luc (baptized 19 September 1616 – ca. 1710) was a Flemish lutenist and composer . Saint-Luc was born in Ath in 1616; nothing is known about his early years. In 1639 he was invited to become a musician at the court in Brussels , and two years later he had his portrait painted by Gerard Seghers . He moved to Paris in the mid- or late 1640s, but returned to Brussels in October 1647. He evidently spent the next few decades in Brussels, marrying in 1658. An important correspondent of Saint-Luc's from these years was Constantijn Huygens . In August 1684 Saint-Luc was still living in Brussels, but nothing is known of his whereabouts during the next 16 years: the next mention of him is from 1700, when he visited Berlin on the occasion of the marriage of Prince Frederick of Hesse-Cassel and Princess Louise Dorothea of Prussia . He apparently traveled to Berlin from Vienna , where, according to contemporary sources, he was employed by Prince Eugene of Savoy . Saint-Luc was still alive in 1707 and 1708, when he published some of his compositions in Amsterdam ; his date of death is unknown. More than 200 pieces by Saint-Luc survive, and show that he was one of the most prominent lutenists of his time. Although he was influenced by French composers ( Ennemond Gaultier , Denis Gaultier , Charles Mouton , and others) and adopted their scheme of grouping pieces into suites, he only used the characteristic French style brisé in his preludes.
