G.W. (Bill) Hopkins (5 June 1943 – 10 March 1981) was a British composer, pianist and music critic. Hopkins was born in Prestbury, Cheshire and educated at Rossall School , Lancashire ; his mother's learning difficulties meant she was unable to look after him, and he was raised by aunts. An encounter with Luigi Nono at Dartington consolidated his interest in serialism; subsequently he studied at Oxford University with Edmund Rubbra and Egon Wellesz . In 1964 he went to Paris, ostensibly to study with Olivier Messiaen but with the prime objective of meeting and studying with Jean Barraqué . Returning to England, he supported himself as a music critic in London and then, after moving first to Tintagel , Cornwall and subsequently to Peel, Isle of Man , by translation and writing music criticism. He married Clare Gilbert in 1972. Subsequently, he taught at Birmingham University and University of Newcastle upon Tyne before succumbing to a heart attack , in Chopwell, near Newcastle, at the age of 37. His few pupils included the British composer Paul Keenan . He was upset at an under-rehearsed first performance of 'En Attendant' in 1977 and this possibly discouraged him from composition for a while. He was working on an opera project, tentatively called Ness , but little if any of this was completed. His principal compositions were: His complete piano works have been edited and recorded by Nicolas Hodges , (col legno, 2000). En Attendant , Two Pomes , Pendant and Sensation have been recorded by Music Projects/London and Richard Bernas , ( NMC , 1992).
