Giorgio Federico Ghedini (11 July 1892 – 25 March 1965) was an Italian composer . In addition to orchestral works, in 1949 he premiered a one-act opera based on the American novella, Billy Budd , by Herman Melville . Ghedini was born in Cuneo in 1892. He studied organ, piano and composition in Turin , then graduated in composition from the Bologna Conservatory under Marco Enrico Bossi in 1911. He worked as conductor for a certain time, then he gave up to devote himself to teaching. He worked as a teacher of composition in Turin (1918-1937), Parma (1937-1941), and finally Milan , where he directed the local Conservatory (1951-1962). Among his pupils, the most eminent were Marcello and Claudio Abbado , Luciano Berio , Guido Cantelli , Niccolò Castiglioni , Carlo Pinelli, and Fiorenzo Carpi . Guido Cantelli conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in a broadcast concert of Ghedini's Pezzo concertante for two violins, viola, and orchestra . He died in Nervi , near Genoa , in 1965. The composer was a deep lover of ancient music; he transcribed many works by such composers as Girolamo Frescobaldi , Claudio Monteverdi , and Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli . Ghedini's works are often inspired by music from the Renaissance and Baroque eras, but combined with a very personal language which combines ancient and modern styles. Among his masterworks are a Concerto for orchestra (in memory of Guido Cantelli ), two violin concertos Il Belprato and Concentus Basiliensis , and a concerto for two cellos L'Olmeneta (The Elm Grove) and Musica Notturna ( Night Music ). Ghedini's most celebrated concert piece is Concerto dell'Albatro ( Albatross Concerto ) for violin, cello, piano, narrator and orchestra, which includes fragments from Herman Melville 's novel Moby-Dick in its final movement. He wrote a large number of chamber, vocal and choral works. He also wrote a one-act opera based on Melville's novella Billy Budd , which was first performed in 1949.
