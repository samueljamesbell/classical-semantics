Simone Molinaro (c. 1565 â€“ 1615) was a composer of the late Renaissance in Italy . He was especially renowned for his lute music. Molinaro was born in Genoa .  He studied music with his uncle, Giovanni Battista dalla Gostena , who was maestro di capella at Genoa Cathedral .  In 1593, Gostena was murdered , and Molinaro succeeded him in his post at the Cathedral in 1599.  The same year he published Intavolatura di liuto , containing lute works both by himself and by Gostena.  In addition to his lute works, Molinaro composed a large amount of sacred choral music, most of which does not survive completely because of missing partbooks .  However, some five-voice motets have been preserved in the collections of Hasler and Schadaeus . Molinaro also served as editor of the works of Carlo Gesualdo , publishing editions of that composer's madrigals in 1585 and 1613.  In his dances for lute, according to Eitner, Molinaro "despises all counterpoint, and shows himself as a pure melodist and harmonist, but both in so simple and pretty a way, that they all have something uncommonly attractive".  Molinaro wrote at the time when, according to Paul Henry Lang, lute music was reaching its apogee.  Along with Giovanni Terzi , Molinaro's lute music introduces "a finished, graceful, and sovereign instrumental style, capable of all shades of expression and of a technique which we usually associate only with the vocal music of the period".  The 1613 publication of the Gesualdo madrigals was ground-breaking because it presented Gesualdo's music in full score as opposed to partbook format.  Molinaro's music was used as the basis for "Balletto detto il Conte Orlando" of the Ancient Airs and Dances Suite No. 1 by Ottorino Respighi .
