Elisabeth Sophie of Mecklenburg, Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg (20 August 1613 – 12 July 1676) was a German poet and composer. She began studying music at the court of her father, Duke John Albert II of Mecklenburg-Güstrow , where there was an orchestra known for its use of fine English musicians, such as William Brade .  She moved to the court of Kassel , which also had a strong musical tradition, when the Thirty Years War threatened her court in 1628. In 1635 she married the learned Augustus the Younger, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg .  They had two children: Elisabeth Sophie was charged with organizing the court orchestra, and at times worked closely with Heinrich Schütz , who was appointed absentes Kapellmeister in 1655. She may have collaborated with him on arias in his Theatralische neue Vorstellung von der Maria Magdalena .  Most of Elisabeth Sophie 's compositions are hymns or devotional arias. Some of these were published in 1651 and 1667. The one printed in 1651, Vinetum evangelicum, Evangelischer Weinberg , is believed to have been the first music published by a woman in Germany.  She also played a major role in establishing large court entertainments, including masquerades , plays, and ballets , to which she at times wrote librettos and music. Her additional involvement in these entertainments is unclear. Two of her dramatic works survive: Friedens Sieg (1642, Brunswick) and Glückwünschende Freudensdarstellung ( Lüneburg , 1652).  Sibylle Ursula von Braunschweig-Lüneburg was her stepdaughter.
