Gustaf Düben (also Gustav ) (1628 – 1690) was a Swedish organist and composer . Düben was born and died in Stockholm .  He was the son of the German-born Andreas Düben , who had been organist at the Thomaskirche in Leipzig , and father of the composer and court kapellmeister Anders Düben (the Younger) . In 1663, he succeeded his father as both hovkapellmästare , director of the Royal Swedish Court Orchestra , and organist of the German St Gertrud Church in Stockholm. He was the father of four children: Gustav von Düben the Younger (1659-1726), Joachim von Düben the Elder (1671-1730), Emerentia von Düben (1669-1743) and Anders von Düben (the Younger) (1673-1738).  Gustaf the younger and Anders the Younger appears to have been the only of his children who followed in his father's footsteps as a composer, courtier and eventually kapellmeister.     The Düben collection of manuscripts includes many unicae of German baroque music.
