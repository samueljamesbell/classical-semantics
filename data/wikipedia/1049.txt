Giovanni Battista Conforti ( fl. 1550–1570) was an Italian composer, born either in Bologna or Parma . In the dedication to his Primo libro de ricercari a quattro voci (Valerio Dorico, Rome, 1558) he says that he "owes much" to Cardinal Niccolò Caetani of Sermoneta , for whom he had probably worked in Rome .  Conforti's Madrigali, libro primo (Venice, 1567), which Claudio Merulo supposedly edited, printed, and published, is dedicated to Anselmo Dandino, the abbot of San Bartolomeo in Ferrara . This work includes a piece, S'hoggi son senz 'honor , written in honor of Adrian Willaert , suggesting that Conforti was connected with Venice and the musicians of St Mark's Basilica . Conforti's ricercari are well respected for their use of idiomatic writing for a number of instruments.
