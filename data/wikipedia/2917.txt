Claudia Rusca (1593 – 6 October 1676) was an Italian composer, singer, and organist. She was a nun at the Umiliate monastery of St. Caterina in Brera . She learned music at home, before she professed her final vows at the convent. She probably wrote her Sacri concerti à 1–5 con salmi e canzoni francesi ( Milan , 1630) for use in the monastery and similar female institutions. The only known copy was destroyed in a fire at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in 1943.
