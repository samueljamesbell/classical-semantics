Petronio Franceschini ( Bologna , January 9, 1651 â€“ Venice , December 4, 1680) was a Baroque composer from Italy. Franceschini studied under Giacomo Antonio Perti and became also the main cellist in Basilica di San Petronio . He produced mainly church music and he is credited with an innovative use of trumpet and voices. In addition, he wrote four operas . He died in Venice before he had the chance to finish a fifth, Dionisio , which was completed by a contemporary of his, Giovanni Domenico Partenio . Today Franceschini's most often performed composition (conceived with San Petronio in mind) is his Sonata in D for two trumpets and strings; this work has been recorded several times since the 1960s.
