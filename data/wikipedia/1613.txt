Evgeny Kirillovich Golubev ( Russian : Евге́ний Кири́ллович Го́лубев  ) (16 February 1910 –  25 December 1988) was a Russian Soviet composer . Golubev was born and died in Moscow .  He was taught by Nikolai Myaskovsky ,  and his students included Iosif Andriasov from 1958 till 1963, Alfred Schnittke , who studied with him from 1953 until 1958  and Michael L. Geller .  His own compositions included at least twenty-four string quartets ,  seven symphonies , three piano concertos - the last dedicated to and recorded by Tatiana Nikolayeva -, concertos for violin , cello and viola , ten piano sonatas (the sixth dedicated to Myaskovsky), sonatas for violin , cello and for trumpet (1956) (the latter dedicated to Sergei Nikolaevich Yeryomin),  and quintets for strings with piano and with harp, among other works.  This harp quintet is one of Golubev's few works that are still occasionally performed. The Soviet state record label Melodiya released several LPs of his music, including the three piano concertos, two of the symphonies, and some chamber works and songs which are no longer easily available. During the last years, some of these old recordings were released on CD. Melodiya has recently reappeared and reissued Nikolayeva's recordings of the 3rd piano concerto and 4th piano sonata (1942–1943).
