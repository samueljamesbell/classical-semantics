Diogo Dias Melgás (often Melgaz ) ( Cuba (Portugal) , 1638 - Évora , 1700) was a Portuguese composer of late- Renaissance sacred polyphony . Diogo Dias Melgás was born in Cuba , Alentejo , on 14 April 1638. He was a choirboy at the Colégio da Claustra in Évora in 1646. He took holy orders at the Cathedral of Évora, where he stayed the rest of his life, being a student of Manuel Rebelo , and holding the position of mestre de capela for about 30 years. He died blind and extremely poor on 3 February 1700. He was the last of the great Portuguese polyphonic masters, who began to flourish in Évora in the second half of the sixteenth century. A large part of Melgás's work is lost. The surviving works - masses , motets , graduals - are kept in the archives of the Cathedrals of Évora and Lisbon , and were published in modern notation by the Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian in 1978 ( Opera Omnia , Portugaliae Musica XXXII).
