The main events of his life were as follows: He may have been Kapellmeister as early as 1814.  His output was prolific, with at least three hundred published compositions in at least 110 opus numbers including at least 9 symphonies, seventy string quartets and many others for winds and strings, about fifteen string quintets  and much sonorous, idiomatic and at times powerful music for wind ensemble, for which he is best known today.
