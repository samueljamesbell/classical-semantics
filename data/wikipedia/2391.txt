Initially firmly part of the avant garde amongst Australian composers, Meale experienced a stylistic rethink in the 1970s, abandoning an exclusively atonal approach in his orchestral work Viridian (1979) and his Second String Quartet (1980) for a polytonal approach, and in later works embracing a frank tonality, with fin-de-siècle overtones, whilst retaining an individual voice. He is best known for the 1986 opera Voss , with libretto by David Malouf based on the novel of the same title by Patrick White . Malouf also collaborated with Meale on his second operatic project, Mer de glace (1986–91), a tableaux-like juxtaposition of some ideas of the novel Frankenstein alongside the real dealings of Mary Shelley with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron . Other works include Very High Kings (1968) and Incredible Floridas (1971). In 2011, Voss was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's Sounds of Australia registry.  The APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA).
