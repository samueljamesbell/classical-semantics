Salvador Contreras Sánchez (10 November 1910 – 7 November 1982) was a Mexican composer and violinist, a member of the Grupo de los cuatro . Contreras was born in Cuerámaro , Guanajuato , the son of José Contreras and Nemoria Sánchez. His musical education was at the Mexico City Conservatory, where he studied violin with Silvestre Revueltas , music theory with Candelario Huízar, and composition and conducting with Carlos Chávez . Together with Daniel Ayala Pérez , Blas Galindo , and José Pablo Moncayo , he formed the Grupo de jóvenes compositores in 1935, which later became the Grupo de los cuatro ( Stevenson 2001 ). Contreras's early works from the 1930s and early 1940s were predominantly contrapuntal and neoclassical , with folk-like tunes and brash rhythms. His Obertura en tiempo de danza (Overture in Dance Time, 1942), for example, prominently uses measures in 7/8 and 5/8, which alternate with the more common 2/4 and 3/4. In the mid 1960s he began using serial techniques , allying him with Manuel Enríquez and losing him his former broad public appeal ( Slonimsky 1945 , 236; Stevenson 2001 ). Among his best-known works are:
