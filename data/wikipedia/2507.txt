Stanley Myers (6 October 1930 – 9 November 1993) was a British film composer who scored over sixty films.  He also wrote the guitar piece " Cavatina ".  Myers was born in Birmingham , Warwickshire , England ; as a teenager he went to King Edward's School in Edgbaston , a suburb of Birmingham.  Myers wrote incidental music for television: for example, The Reign of Terror , a 1964 serial in the television series Doctor Who ; the theme to All Gas and Gaiters ; and the theme for the BBC 's Question Time .   He is known for composing music for the cult horror films House of Whipcord , Frightmare , House of Mortal Sin and Schizo for filmmaker Pete Walker .   He is best known for " Cavatina " (1970), an evocative guitar piece that served as the signature theme for Michael Cimino 's 1978 film The Deer Hunter , and for which Myers won the Ivor Novello Award .  A somewhat different version of this work, performed by John Williams , had appeared in The Walking Stick . And yet another version had lyrics added. Cleo Laine and Iris Williams, in separate recordings as He Was Beautiful , helped to make "Cavatina" become even more popular. During the 1980s, Myers worked frequently with director Stephen Frears . His score for Prick Up Your Ears (1987) won him a "Best Artistic Contribution" award at the Cannes Film Festival .  He also scored the film Wish You Were Here  and several low budget features ( Time Traveler , Blind Date , The Wind , Zero Boys ) for director Nico Mastorakis, collaborating with Hans Zimmer . He won another Ivor Novello Award for his soundtrack to The Witches in 1991.  Myers died of cancer aged 63 in Kensington and Chelsea , London .
