Clement Liebert ( fl. 1433–1454) was a Franco-Flemish singer and composer of the early Renaissance , active in Rome and at the Burgundian court. His life is only documented briefly for two periods.  Like many composers who originated in the modern-day Low Countries , he spent time in Italy , and sang in the papal chapel in 1433.  His presence is also recorded in the Burgundian court chapel, where he was employed as a singer from 1441 to 1454.  Only one piece of music is securely attributed to him, a song entitled Comment porray .  The manuscript containing it, formerly in the Strasbourg Bibliothèque Municipale, was destroyed on 24 August 1870, during the Siege of Strasbourg in the Franco-Prussian War .  It is not known if Liebert was related to Reginaldus Libert (Liebert), another Burgundian composer who was one of the first to use fauxbourdon in a setting of the Ordinary of the Mass .  It is also possible that Clement Liebert is the same as a J. de Climen, a composer of around 1430, to whom a two-voice canon was attributed in a manuscript formerly from a Strasbourg library, now destroyed.
