Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer (some authorities use the spelling Johann Kaspar Ferdinand Fischer ) ( c. 1656 – August 27, 1746) was a German Baroque composer. Johann Nikolaus Forkel ranked Fischer as one of the best composers for keyboard of his day;  however, partly due to the rarity of surviving copies of his music, his music is rarely heard today. Fischer seems to have been of Bohemian origin, possibly born at Schönfeld , but details about his life are sketchy. Fischer was baptized and spent his youth in Schlackenwerth, north-west Bohemia. The first record of his existence is found in the mid-1690s: by 1695 he was Kapellmeister to Ludwig Wilhelm of Baden , and he may have remained with the court until his death in Rastatt . Much of Fischer's music shows the influence of the French Baroque style, exemplified by Jean Baptiste Lully , and he was responsible for bringing the French influence to German music. Fischer's harpsichord suites updated the standard Froberger model ( Allemande - Courante - Sarabande - Gigue ); he was also one of the first composers to apply the principles of the orchestral suite to the harpsichord, replacing the standard French ouverture with an unmeasured prelude . Both Bach and Handel knew Fischer's work and sometimes borrowed from it. Many compositions by Fischer were published during his lifetime. These published pieces include: Evidence exists of numerous lost works, among them an opera in Italian style, miscellaneous chamber works , court music and keyboard pieces.
