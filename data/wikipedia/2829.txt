Cesarina Ricci de Tingoli (born ca. 1573) was an Italian composer. She was related to the family of Cardinal Giovanni Ricci (1497â€“1574) by birth, and the noble family of Tingoli by marriage. Her only known publication is Il Primo libro de madrigali a cinque voci, con un dialogo a otto novamente composti & dati in luce (Venice, 1597). This publication survives in two partbooks , and a manuscript tablature also survives. The cantus and quintus partbooks do not survive. Il primo libro contains 14 five-voice madrigals and an eight-voice dialogue by Ricci, and two madrigals by Alberto Ghirlinzoni , who is only known from this publication. The texts are by Torquato Tasso , Giovanni Battista Guarini , and Antonio Ongaro , all of whom were associated with the academy of Cardinal Cinzio Aldobrandini , to whom the publication is also dedicated. Ruggiero Giovannelli might have been her teacher.
