Admitted at the age of 9 years to the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris , he studied composition with Paul Dukas , piano with Lazare Lévy , harmony with Jean Gallon , and counterpoint with Noël Gallon . He received first prizes in piano and in harmony in 1930 at 13 years.  Aged 14 he won the first prize for accompanists, and in 1934, he received the second Prix de Rome  with his cantata The legend of Roukmani (first prize was awarded to Eugène Bozza ). The following year, he was honored by Louis Diémer . With Henry Merckel Hubeau made a highly praised recording of Mozart's violin sonata K454 in 1941.  In 1941, when Claude Delvincourt was appointed director of the Conservatoire, Hubeau was appointed to the vacancy left by Delvincourt at the head of the Music Academy in Versailles.  In addition, he took the post of professor of chamber music of the Paris Conservatory from 1957 to 1982 where he trained many students such as Jacques Rouvier , Géry Moutier, Michel Dalberto , Jean-Yves Thibaudet , Olivier Charlier , Roland Daugareil, Cécilia Tsan, and Sonia Wieder-Atherton. Landormy described Hubeau's compositional style as using a simple language, with no revolutionary intent, but displaying a freshness of invention evident in thematic material, rhythm and use of timbres.
