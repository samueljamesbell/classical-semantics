Richard Davy (c. 1465â€“1507) was a Renaissance composer, organist and choirmaster, one of the most represented in the Eton Choirbook . Little is known about the life of Richard Davy. His name was a common one in Devon and he may have been born there. He was a scholar of Magdalen College, Oxford , and acted as choir master and organist at least in the period 1490-2.  Churchwardens' accounts for Ashburton, Devon , mention a 'Dom. Richardus Dave:' from 1493-5, where he may have been acting as a chaplain or as master of the nearby school at St. Lawrence Chapel.  He may then have moved to Exeter Cathedral to be vicar choral in the period 1497-1506.  Davy is the second most represented composer in the Eton choirbook , with nine compositions including his most celebrated work, the Passio Domini in ramis palmarum or Passion according to St Matthew .  His work is considered more florid than that of his contemporaries Robert Fayrfax and William Cornish and may have had considerable impact on later figures such as John Taverner .
