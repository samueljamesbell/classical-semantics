Friedrich Jeremias Witt (November 8, 1770 – January 3, 1836) was a German composer and cellist . He is perhaps best known as the likely author of a Symphony in C major known as the Jena Symphony , once attributed to Ludwig van Beethoven . Witt was born in 1770, the same year as Beethoven , and was a German composer of considerable stature in his time.
He was born in the Württemberg village of Niederstetten , the son of a cantor and court clerk. Witt became a cellist (some accounts say a violinist ) in the court orchestra of Oettingen-Wallerstein when he was nineteen, taking composition lessons there with Antonio Rosetti -  that is, the Bohemian-born Anton Rosler.  Witt was most famous in his lifetime for his oratorio Der leidende Heiland - in English, The Suffering Saviour, securing an appointment as Kapellmeister for the Prince of Würzburg , and later for the theater, where he stayed until his death. He also wrote two operas : Palma (1804) and Das Fischerweib (1806). His other compositions include concertos , church music , chamber music and symphonies . His best-known work, a symphony in C major known as the Jena, is largely based on the Symphony No. 97 by Joseph Haydn . Stephen Fisher compiled a thematic index of Witt's symphonies.
