In the course of 1853 the composer was working on two books, one for the Opera House and the other to the Opéra-Comique of Paris.  The first of these pieces Le Maitre à Chanter, a grand opera in two acts set to a libretto of Henri Trianon , choreographed by Joseph Mazilier, successfully premiered at the Academy of Music on 17 October 1853.  His opera Yvonne (1859), set to a libretto by Eugène Scribe ,  premiered at the Theatre de l'Opéra-Comique on 29 November 1859 and was also well received.
