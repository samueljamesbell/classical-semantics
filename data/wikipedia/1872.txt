Jean Eichelberger Ivey (July 3, 1923  â€“ May 2, 2010) was an American composer who produced an extensive and diverse catalog of works in virtually every medium, including solo, chamber , vocal, orchestral, in addition to being a, "respected electronic composer."  Her music has been frequently represented on the programs of major orchestras and ensembles. She founded the Peabody Electronic Music Studio in 1967, and taught composition and electronic music at the Peabody Conservatory of Music until her retirement. Most of her works which include electronics do so in combination with live musicians. The Baltimore Symphony premiered two of her works which combine tape with orchestra, and her music has been recorded on the CRI , Folkways and Grenadilla labels. Her publishers include Boosey and Hawkes , Carl Fischer, Inc. and E.C. Schirmer. Ivey is listed in such reference works as the New Grove Dictionary of Music  and Who's Who in America . She is also the subject of a half-hour documentary film prepared in Washington: A Woman Is... a Composer . Her awards include a Guggenheim fellowship ,  two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts , annual ASCAP awards since 1972, the Peabody Director's Recognition Award, and the Peabody Distinguished Alumni Award. She has expressed her compositional ideals as follows: "I consider all the musical resources of the past and present as being at the composer's disposal, but always in the service of the effective communication of humanistic ideas and intuitive emotion." Her many notable composition students include Michael Hedges , Carlos Sanchez-Gutierrez , Geoffrey Dorian Wright , Richard Dudas , McGregor Boyle , Vivian Adelberg Rudow , Lynn F. Kowal and Daniel Crozier .
