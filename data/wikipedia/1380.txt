Willem de Fesch ( Dutch pronunciation: [ʋɪllɛm dɛ fɛs ] , 1687, Alkmaar – 3 January 1761) was a virtuoso Dutch violone player and composer . The pupil of Karel Rosier , who was a Vice- Kapellmeister at Bonn , de Fesch later married his daughter, Maria Anna Rosier. De Fesch was active in Amsterdam between 1710 and 1725. From 1725 to 1731 he served as Kapellmeister at Antwerp Cathedral . Thereafter he moved to London where he gave concerts and played the violone in Handel 's orchestra in 1746. In 1748 and 1749 he conducted at Marylebone Gardens . He apparently made no public appearances after 1750. His works included the oratorios Judith (1732) and Joseph (1746), as well as chamber duets, solo and trio sonatas , concertos and part songs. Both oratorios were thought lost until 1980 when a copy of a manuscript of Joseph was found in London's Royal Academy of Music .  De Fesch's music was influenced by the Italians, particularly Vivaldi , as well as Handel.
