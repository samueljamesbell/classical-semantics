Francesco Manelli (Mannelli) ( c. 1595 – 1667) was a Roman Baroque composer , particularly of opera , and a theorbo player. He is most well known for his collaboration with fellow Roman composer Benedetto Ferrari in bringing commercial opera to Venice .  The first two works, in 1637 and 1638, to be put on commercially in the Teatro San Cassiano were both by Manelli - his L'Andromeda and La Maga Fulminata . Francesco Manelli was for many years confused with the Franciscan friar Giovanni Battista Fasolo , because of the resemblances between Manelli’s cantata Luciata , (published in Musiche varie, op. 4 Venice, 1636), and Fasolo’s dialogue Il carro di Madama Lucia (Rome, 1628), and the shared text of the first piece in both collections. In a comparison of the two cantatas Fasolo's version  is "languid and melancholy", while Manelli's version  is "spirited and biting".  Operas, music for all of which is lost. Cantatas
