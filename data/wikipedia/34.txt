Marcial del Adalid y Gurréa (24 August 1826 – 16 October 1881) was a Spanish composer .  He studied music in London between 1840 and 1844 with Ignaz Moscheles and it is possible that he also studied with Chopin in Paris . Both men influenced the style and form of his musical compositions. After finishing his studies, Adalid y Gurréa returned to Spain where he lived in A Coruña and later Madrid . Highly influenced by lieder , his most important compositions were vocal art songs and songs for the piano. A particularly fine example of his work is his 1877 composition Cantares nuevos y viejos de Galicia where he successfully blended the folklore of Galicia with the technique and spirit of Romantic piano music. He also composed one opera Inese e Bianca , which was never staged.  In addition to composing, Adalid y Gurréa spent much of his time teaching music courses and organizing music competitions.
