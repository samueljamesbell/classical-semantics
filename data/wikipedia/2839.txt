Henri-Joseph Rigel (9 February 1741 – 2 May 1799) was a German -born composer of the Classical era who spent most of his working life in France . He was born in Wertheim am Main where his father was musical intendant to the local prince. After an education in Germany, where his teachers included Niccolò Jommelli , Rigel moved to Paris in 1767. He quickly acquired a reputation in musical circles and published harpsichord pieces, string quartets , symphonies and concertos . He began composing for the Concert Spirituel , most notably four hiérodrames ( oratorios on sacred themes): La sortie d'Egypte (1774), La destruction de Jericho (1778), Jephté (1783) and Les Macchabées (score lost). These show the influence of Christoph Willibald Gluck , and Gluck himself praised La sortie d'Égypte . Between 1778 and 1799 Rigel also wrote 14 operas , including the opéra comique Le savetier et le financier (1778).
