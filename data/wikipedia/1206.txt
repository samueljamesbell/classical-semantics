John Thomas Douglass (1847â€“1886) was an accomplished American violinist who composed Virginia's Ball , which is the first known opera written by an African American, copyrighted in 1868. It was performed at least once, but is now lost.  Virginia's Ball was a three-act opera, premiered in 1868 in New York, at the Stuyvesant Institute on Broadway .  Douglass probably studied in Europe, but settled in New York, and began performing widely in the 1870s. In addition to touring as a concert violinist, he also worked with a string ensemble and various minstrel companies, including the Hyers Sisters and the Georgia Minstrels .  Douglass also managed a teaching studio, where he met David Mannes , later of the New York Symphony Orchestra , who founded a music school for African American students in New York.
