Colonel Sanford C. 'Sandy' Faulkner (1806â€“1874) was an American teller of tall tales, fiddle player, and composer of the popular fiddle tune " The Arkansas Traveler ", which was the State song of Arkansas from 1949 to 1963 and has been the state historical song since 1987. Colonel Faulkner served in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War , and was at one point placed in command of the Arsenal at Little Rock, Arkansas . The song inspired Edward Washburn to paint the painting of the same name, which later became a popular Currier & Ives lithograph . Faulkner County, Arkansas is named in honor of Sanford Faulkner.
