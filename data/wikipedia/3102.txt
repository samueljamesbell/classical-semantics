Giovanni Battista Somis (December 25, 1686 â€“ August 14, 1763)  was an Italian violinist and composer of the Baroque music era . He studied under Arcangelo Corelli between 1703 and 1706 or 1707.  He was later appointed solo violinist to the king at Turin and leader of the royal band, and seems scarcely ever to have left Turin after these appointments. A trip to Paris in 1731 to play at the Concert Spirituel produced a report in the April 1733 Le Mercure praising his playing.  He published eight opus numbers in all: He formed a style more brilliant and more emotional, and caused a decided step forward in the art of violin playing. He was the teacher of Jean-Marie Leclair ,  Felice Giardini , Louis-Gabriel Guillemain , and Chabran,  as well as Gaetano Pugnani , and he forms a connecting link between the classical schools of Italy and France.  He died in Turin .
