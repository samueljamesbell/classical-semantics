After leaving Leipzig to continue his first studies of music, he met Richard Strauss and fell in with his circle.  Bischoff's two symphonies have been recorded on the record label Classic Produktion Osnabrück , along with a 1926 Introduction und Rondo .  His first symphony, dedicated Herrn Dr. Richard Strauss  was performed (premiered?) in Essen in the same festival (The 42nd Tonkünstler-Festival) in 1906 (May 24-8, 1906) that saw the premiere of Mahler's Sixth Symphony .
