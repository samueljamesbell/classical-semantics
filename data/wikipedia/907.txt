Giuseppe Antonio Capuzzi (also Capucci ; 1 August 1755 â€“ 28 March 1818) was an Italian violinist and composer . Although popular in his day, most of his music is now forgotten. The most commonly performed piece today is his concerto for double bass . The concerto was found in the British Museum by Philip Catelinet, and was dedicated to Kavalier Marcantonio Montenigo, who is assumed to have performed on that instrument. An arrangement of the second (andante) and third (rondo) movements of the concerto is also performed on tuba , euphonium , and trombone . In addition Philip Catelinet arranged all three movements of the concerto for concert band and symphony orchestra. He performed it several times during his tenure at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. His students also performed it. The parts may be obtained from Barry Catelinet. Several of Capuzzi's string quintets are also performed by chamber groups.
