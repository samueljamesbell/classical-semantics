Donald Oscar Banks (25 October 1923 – 5 September 1980) was an Australian composer of concert, jazz, and commercial music. Banks was born in South Melbourne, and initially studied at the University of Melbourne under Waldemar Seidel .  He served in the armed forces from 1941 to 1946.  In 1950 he moved to London where he studied with Mátyás Seiber . Further studies with Milton Babbitt , Luigi Dallapiccola , and Luigi Nono (at a summer school in 1956 at Hermann Scherchen 's villa in Gravesano , Switzerland ) convinced him of the merits of serialism , which he incorporated into his compositional technique. Through Seiber, he gained contacts in the film industry, where he became a frequent composer of music, mainly for cartoons, and the horror movies produced by Hammer Films . Beginning in the mid-1960s, he composed a number of works in the Third Stream style espoused by Gunther Schuller , mixing jazz and concert-music idioms, and began a series of works using electronic music materials.
