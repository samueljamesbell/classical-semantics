Richard Loqueville (died 1418, in Cambrai ) was a French Medieval and Renaissance transitional composer . He played the harp and taught it to the son of the Duke of Bar in 1410, as well as taught plainsong to the Duke's choirboys. From 1413 he taught music at Cambrai Cathedral , where he almost certainly taught Guillaume Dufay .  Attributed to him are four rondeaux , a ballade , an isorhythmic motet in honour of the Breton saint Yvo, a Marian motet, and several Mass movements.
