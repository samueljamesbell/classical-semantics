Carlo Grossi (c. 1634 – 14 May 1688) was an Italian composer . He is believed to have been the first composer to use the term "divertimento", in his 1681 composition Il divertimento de' grandi musiche da camera, ò per servizio di tavola. He was the organist at the church of SS. Giovanni e Paolo. He is also known for setting Hebrew religious texts to recitative in the style of Claudio Monteverdi , such as in his Cantata Ebraica in Dialogo , a work commissioned from Grossi (himself a Gentile ) by the relatively free and well-off Jewish community of Modena . This work was likely intended for performance by an amateur choir (the choral parts are relatively simple, suggesting deliberate tailoring to the capabilities of less advanced musicians) with professional-standard operatic soloists.  Grossi died in 1688 at Venice .
