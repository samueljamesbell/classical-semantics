Franciscus Bossinensis ( fl. 1509 â€“ 1511) ( Francis the Bosnian ) was a lutenist - composer active in Italy in the 15th century. Although his name suggests a Bosnian origin, this is a point of historical debate.  He lived and worked in Venice . He published two collections of lute music (containing 126 frottolas and 46 ricercares ), printed by the Venetian printing house of Ottaviano Petrucci .
