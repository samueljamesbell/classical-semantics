Estêvão de Brito (c. 1570–1641) was a Portuguese composer of polyphony . Estêvão de Brito was born in Serpa , Portugal . He studied music at the Cathedral of Évora with Filipe de Magalhães . In January 1597 he was already mestre de capela of the Cathedral of Badajoz ( Spain ), where he stayed until 1613. In that year, he went to the cathedral of Málaga and succeeded Francisco Vásquez bearing the same office as Cristóbal de Morales , precisely 50 years before. He stayed in Málaga until his death in 1641. It is known that de Brito composed numerous villancicos and cançonetas , most of them for the Christian feasts of Christmas and Corpus Christi . Unfortunately, these works were lost due to the devastation of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake . However, the most relevant in de Brito's work are the liturgic pieces: 4-, 5-, 6-, and 8-voice masses , motets , psalms , and hymns .
