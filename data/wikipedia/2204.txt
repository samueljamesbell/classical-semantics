Anders Bo Leif Linde (1 January 1933 – 2 October 1970) was a Swedish composer whose style resembled that of notable 20th-century neoclassical composers like Benjamin Britten and Samuel Barber .  Born in Gävle , Linde studied music theory with Eric Harald Bengtson before enrolling at the Stockholm Academy of Music in 1948, where he studied composition with Lars-Erik Larsson and piano with Olof Wibergh . In 1953, one year after leaving the academy, he went to Vienna to study conducting and traveled around Europe before returning to Sweden. His most performed piece is probably his violin concerto .  Bo Linde died of unclear health issues perhaps related to drinking,
