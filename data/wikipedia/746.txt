Louis Brassin (24 June 1840 – 17 May 1884) was a Belgian pianist, composer and music educator.  He is best known now for his piano transcription of the Magic Fire Music from Wagner 's Die Walküre . Louis Brassin was born in Aix-la-Chapelle in 1840.  His father was a baritone named de Brassine, whose career took him and his family abroad.  Louis gave his first concert at the age of six, in Hamburg . At age seven he entered the Leipzig Conservatory as a pupil of Ignaz Moscheles .  In 1852 he went on concert tours with his two brothers.  In 1857 he adopted the surname Brassin.  In 1866-67 he taught at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin , succeeding Hans von Bülow , then resumed concertising. He was piano professor at the Brussels Conservatoire 1868-78, and played an important role in the musical life of the country. Among his pupils there were Edgar Tinel , Arthur De Greef , Franz Rummel and Alfred Wotquenne . In 1878 he took over the piano class of Theodor Leschetizky at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory , where his pupils included Vasily Safonov , Wassily Sapellnikoff and Genary Korganov.  He died in Saint Petersburg in 1884, aged 43. Brassin's piano transcription of the Magic Fire Music from Wagner 's Die Walküre was long a concert favourite, and has been recorded many times.
