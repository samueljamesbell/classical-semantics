Vincenzo Ugolini (ca. 1580 â€“ 6 May 1638) was an Italian composer of the early Baroque era and of the Roman School . Born in Perugia , he was first a puer chori (boy soprano) at San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome under Giovanni Bernardino Nanino ; then he was engaged as a contralto until July 1594 and as a bass from the beginning of May 1600 until the end of 1601. In 1603 he was mastro di capella of Santa Maria Maggiore, in Rome. After an illness in 1606, in 1609 he left this work and became maestro at the Duomo of Benevento until 1615 (but in 1614 he worked for Cardinal Arrigoni in Rome). From 2 July 1616 he turned to San Luigi dei Francesi holding the same positions, and in 1620 he succeeded Francesco Soriano as maestro of the Cappella Giulia at San Pietro. In 1629 he was deponent for the testament of the composer Domenico Allegri , brother of Gregorio . From May 1631 he was again maestro of San Luigi, and held the post until his death in 1638; his successor was his pupil Orazio Benevoli .
