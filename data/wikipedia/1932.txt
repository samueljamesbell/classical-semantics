Miloslav Kabeláč (1 August 1908 – 17 September 1979) was a prominent Czech composer and conductor . Miloslav Kabeláč belongs to the foremost Czech symphonists, whose work is sometimes compared with Antonín Dvořák 's and Bohuslav Martinů 's. In the totalitarian period Kabeláč's work found itself on the periphery of official attention and was performed only sporadically and in a limited choice of compositions. Kabeláč was born in Prague . In 1928–31 he studied at the Prague Conservatory as a pupil of Karel Boleslav Jirák , simultaneously (in 1930–31) he was a pupil of Alois Hába . In 1932–54 Kabeláč was employed by Prague Radio. From 1957 to 1968 he worked as a teacher at the Prague Conservatory. During his life Kabeláč was active in Umělecká beseda , in the Federation of Czechoslovak Composers and other organisations. In the 1960s he tried to revive contacts with Western modern music and composers, but after the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia he was silenced. His works were performed only abroad from then on.
