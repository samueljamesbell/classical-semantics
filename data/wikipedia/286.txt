Aaron Avshalomov ( Russian : Ааро́н Авшало́мов ;  11 November 1894 – 26 April 1965) was a Russian-born Jewish composer . Born into a Mountain Jewish family in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur , Russia, Avshalomov was sent for medical studies to Zürich .  After the October Revolution in 1917, which made further studies in Europe impossible, his family sent him to the United States. There he married a fellow Russian émigré in San Francisco.  Less than a year later, he chose to move to China,  where he entered the world of Shanghai 's academia and, together with other highly qualified Jewish musicians (i.e., Alfred Wittenberg , Walter Joachim , Arrigo Foa , etc.), who had fled the Russian pogroms and revolution , trained a number of young Chinese musicians in classical music, who in turn became leading musicians in contemporary China.  Between 1918 and 1947, he worked to create a synthesis of Chinese musical elements and Western techniques of orchestral composition .  In 1919, his son, Jacob Avshalomov was born, who became a  composer and conductor, too. In 1947, he moved to the United States, where he already had spent three years in the mid-1920s.  He died in New York. [ citation needed ]
