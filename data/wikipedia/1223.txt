Cornelius Heinrich Dretzel (18 September 1697 (bapt.) – 7 May 1775) was a German organist and composer. He was born in Nuremberg , where he appears to have spent his whole life in various organists' posts, including: He may have studied with J.S. Bach in Weimar (1716–1717), and his compositions reveal points of contact with Bach. They include a concerto for harpsichord solo, perhaps modelled on the Italian Concerto ; this solo concerto was once thought to be by Bach; an early version of the slow movement was entered in the first edition of Schmieder's catalog as BWV897:1.
