Giuseppe Valentini (14 December 1681 – November 1753), nicknamed Straccioncino (Little Ragamuffin), was an Italian violinist , painter , poet , and composer , though he is known chiefly as a composer of inventive instrumental music. He studied under Giovanni Bononcini in Rome between 1692 and 1697. From 1710 to 1727 he served as ‘Suonator di Violino, e Componitore di Musica’ to Prince Michelangelo Caetani . He also succeeded Corelli as director of the concertino at San Luigi dei Francesi , from 1710 to 1741. Though during his lifetime overshadowed by the likes of Corelli, Vivaldi , and Locatelli , his contribution to Italian baroque music is noteworthy, and many of his works were published throughout Europe.
