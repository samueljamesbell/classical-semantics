Gaspar Cassadó i Moreu (30 September 1897 – 24 December 1966) was a Spanish cellist and composer of the early 20th century. He was born in Barcelona to a church musician father, Joaquim Cassadó, and began taking cello lessons at age seven. When he was nine, he played in a recital where Pablo Casals was in the audience; Casals immediately offered to teach him. The city of Barcelona awarded him a scholarship so that he could study with Casals in Paris. He was also the author of several notable musical hoaxes ,  notably the "Toccata"  that he attributed to Frescobaldi.  The personal papers of Cassadó's father are preserved in the Biblioteca de Catalunya . Gaspar's own papers, along with those of his wife, the pianist Chieko Hara , are preserved at the Tamagawa University Museum of Education.  Cassadó's many transcriptions are listed below his original works.
