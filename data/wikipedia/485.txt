Ralph Benatzky (5 June 1884 – 16 October 1957), born in Moravské Budějovice as Rudolf Josef František Benatzki , was an Austrian composer of Czech  origin (when Benatzky was born Bohemia was part of the Austrian Empire; Benatzky mostly worked in Vienna). He composed operas and operettas , such as Casanova (1928) , Die drei Musketiere (1929), Im weißen Rössl (1930) and Meine Schwester und ich (1930). He died in Zürich , Switzerland . Benatzky is often mistakenly referred to as Jewish due to an error published in a book of Jewish musicians during World War II. Benatzky himself was not Jewish, but he was twice married to Jewish women: Josma Selim , a singer ( Hedwig Josma Fischer ; born 1884 in Wien; died 1929 in Berlin) and Melanie "Mela" Hoffmann , a dancer.
