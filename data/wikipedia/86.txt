Pedro Albéniz y Basanta (14 April 1795 – 12 April 1855) was a Spanish pianist and composer .  He was unrelated to Isaac Albéniz .  Albéniz was born Logroño , La Rioja .  He began his studies with his father Mateo Albéniz , a notable church musician in Spain.  He furthered his education in Paris , where he was instructed by eminent teachers and received musical advice from Rossini . Returning to Spain, he served as organist at the Church of Santa María in San Sebastián and then became a professor at the Madrid Royal Conservatory , organist of the Capilla Real , and the personal piano teacher of Queen Isabella II .  He died in Madrid . His career as a concert pianist did not maintain the splendor of its beginnings, because he dedicated himself instead to teaching.  He was a mediocre composer who was subsequently remembered chiefly for his piano method , which was studied by all Spanish pianists at the Madrid Conservatory during the mid-19th century.
