Dieudonné-Félix Godefroid (24 July 1818 - 12 July 1897) was a Belgian harpist , who composed for his instrument and for the piano. Félix Godefroid was born at Namur , where his father failed in a theatre venture and moved the family to Boulogne-sur-Mer , where he opened a music school. In 1832 Félix entered the Conservatoire de Paris to study harp with François Joseph Naderman and Théodore Labarre . Impressed with the pedal harp perfected by Sébastien Érard , Godefroid elected to pursue a concert career. From 1839, he began a brilliant solo tour through Europe and the Levant. In 1847, Félix Godefroid settled in Paris and finally made his debut there. Called the "Paganini of the harp" he became a great virtuoso, giving concerts throughout Europe. Besides his pieces for harp and for piano, on which he was also a virtuoso performer, Godefroid composed masses and two operas, La Harpe d'or and La Fille de Saül . His didactic work Mes exercices pour la harpe was employed by several generations of harpists. The Belgian painter Félicien Rops painted his portrait in August 1856. His older brother Jules-Joseph Godefroid (1811-1840) was also a harpist and composer. Godefroid died in Villers-sur-Mer.  The Concours Godefroid , established to mark the centennial of his death, is held every three years at his native city of Namur and nearby Belgian cities.
