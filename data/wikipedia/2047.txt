Friedrich Ludwig Æmilius Kunzen (24 September 1761 – 28 January 1817) was a German composer and conductor who lived and worked for much of his life in Denmark . He was born in Lübeck , where his father, Adolph Carl Kunzen, was an organist and his grandfather, Johann Paul Kunzen (1696-1757), had composed for the Hamburg Opera in the  1720s. In 1781 he began studying law in Kiel , but his true love was music, and in 1784, encouraged by composer Johann Abraham Peter Schulz , he moved to Copenhagen to pursue  a musical career. He performed as a pianist at court and in clubs, and in the next few years had successes with a memorial cantata for Count Otto Thott and music for the marriage of Crown Princess Louise Auguste to Frederik Christian II, Duke of Augustenborg , as well as theatre music. In 1788 he met the young author Jens Baggesen , and the two collaborated on the opera Holger Danske , which premiered the following year, causing the "Holger Feud," as a result of which Kunzen temporarily left the country. For the next two years he lived in Berlin . From 1792 until 1794 he worked as musical director of the new Frankfurter National-Theater , where he put on Mozart 's Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute . During his stay in Frankfurt he married one of the foremost singers of the era, Johanna Margaretha Antonetta Zuccarini (1766-1842).

His obligations were numerous, his salary poor, and his enthusiasm about Mozart was met with indigenous scepticism. As a consequence, Cosi fan tutte failed spectacularly in 1798."  However, he had successes with Don Giovanni (1807) and Die Entführung aus dem Serail (1813). [ citation needed ] Aside from an occasional composition for the court and city, he composed the oratorio Opstandelsen (The Resurrection, 1796), the grand opera Erik Ejegod (1798), and various hymns and Singspiele . In 1809, he was appointed professor, and in 1811 he was honoured as a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog and appointed a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music . On 28 January 1817, he suffered a stroke and died after an argument with Jens Baggesen over a plagiarism controversy concerning the opera Trylleharpen (The Magic Harp), which had been performed in 1806 in Vienna and Hamburg in German as Ossians Harfe , but without success.
