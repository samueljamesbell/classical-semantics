Other collaborators include Bjørn Nørgaard , Carlo Quartucci , Carla Tato , Ernst Kretzer , Ben Patterson , David Moss , Ute Wassermann , Andreas Oldörp , Christophe Charles , Bernd Jasper , Henrik Kiel , Vilem Wagner , Vladimir Tarasov , Niko Tenten , and many others. [ citation needed ] His overall goal was to work collaboratively and to trespass conventional boundaries. He resented the idea of an isolated artistic genius and his entire production can be seen as a subsequent and vibrant example of praxis in a constant flux. He believed in the need to trespass conventional boundaries between artistic disciplines. This is visible from his engagement in Fluxus, over numerous collaborative performances to his position as a professor at the Art Academy in Hamburg ( Hochschule für Bildende Künste - HfBK).

He presented a retrospective exhibition in Copenhagen and participated in the music festival Wundergrund shortly before his death. [ citation needed ]
