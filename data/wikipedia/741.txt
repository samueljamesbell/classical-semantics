Willi Brandt (1869–1923) was a German composer and trumpet virtuoso. The only source available to the author, so far, is an article by Wolfgang Marx (translated by Roger Clement ) printed in the CD-leaflet of a CD with virtuoso trumpet music by Sergei Nakariakov . Marx says: "Willi Brandt was one of the late 19th century's greatest virtuosos. Like Jean-Baptiste Arban , he also taught at music conservatories in addition to performing in public. He wrote methods and textbooks which are still in use today. His Konzertstück No. 2, just like his other works, still represents a challenge to every trumpet player today".
