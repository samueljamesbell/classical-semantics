Nycasius de Clibano (also Nicasius , Casijn ) ( fl. 1457 â€“ 1497) was a Franco-Flemish singer and composer of the Renaissance , probably active only in his homeland, the southern part of the Netherlands . He was the father of the slightly better-known composer Jheronimus de Clibano , as well as Jan de Clibano, who is known only to have been a singer, not a composer.  Nycasius probably was born in the south Netherlands , and he seems to have spent his entire career in 's-Hertogenbosch .  He first appears in the records there in 1457, when he was brought in as a singer at the Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady (Illustre Lieve Vrouwe Broederschap). The next year he married, and in 1466 or 1467 he became a member of the Brotherhood, rising in the ecclesiastical ranks through the 1470s.  Among his duties was recruiting new singers from other cities; a trip to Cambrai and Antwerp is documented during which he sought to find new members for the choir.  In 1493 or 1494 he became the choirmaster.  The last record of his life comes from 1497, and in 1498 Matthaeus Pipelare took over his duties at the Brotherhood, presumably because he had died, though the event is not recorded.  Only one work is known to be by Nycasius with reasonable certainty, a Credo Vilayge , which exists in multiple sources, although even this attribution has been questioned.
