Ricard Lamote de Grignon i Ribas ( Catalan pronunciation: [riˈkard laˈmɔd də ɡɾiˈɲɔn] ; 25 September 1899 – 5 February 1962), was a Catalan Spanish composer and orchestral conductor. Ricard Lamote de Grignon was born and died in Barcelona .  He was the only son of the composer Joan Lamote de Grignon and Florentina Ribas. He was initiated into the world of music by his father, then later studied at the Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu and at the Academia Marshall,  both in Barcelona. At the age of 20 he joined the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra and the Gran Teatre del Liceu as a cellist.  In 1930 he was appointed director of the Girona Symphony Orchestra and in 1932 he won the appointment as assistant conductor of the Barcelona Municipal Band. At the onset of the Spanish Civil War he fled to Valencia to join his father, working alongside him as assistant director of the newly created Municipal Orchestra.  In 1948 he returned to Barcelona but, finding it impossible to regain his place as director of the Municipal Band, dedicated himself to musical composition and study.  In 1957 he occupied the post of deputy director of the Municipal Orchestra, collaborating with his great friend Eduard Toldrà until his death in 1962. His work includes many pieces for piano, symphonic poems, also chamber music and music for choir with symphony orchestra, not forgetting his additions to the repertoire of sardana dance and band music. The archive of the Lamote de Grignon family, with works by Ricard and his father Joan, is at the Musical Document Repository of the Generalitat of Catalunya and may be studied in the Biblioteca de Catalunya .
