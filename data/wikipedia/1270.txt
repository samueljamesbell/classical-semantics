Michael East (or Easte , Est , Este ) (ca. 1580–1648) was an English organist and composer. He was a nephew of London music publisher Thomas East (ca. 1540–1608), although it was once 
thought that he was his son.  In 1601, East wrote a madrigal that was accepted by Thomas Morley for publication in his collection The Triumphs of Oriana .  In 1606, he received a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Cambridge  and in 1609 he joined the choir of Ely Cathedral , initially as a lay clerk.  By 1618 he was employed by Lichfield Cathedral , where he worked as a choirmaster, probably until 1644, when the Civil War brought an end to sung services.  Elias Ashmole was a chorister at Lichfield, and later recalled that "Mr Michael East … was my tutor for song and Mr Henry Hinde, organist of the Cathedral … taught me on the virginals and organ".  East's exact date of death is not known, but he died at Lichfield . His will was written on 7 January 1648 and proved on 9 May 1648. It mentions his wife Dorothy, daughter Mary Hamersly, and a son and grandson both named Michael.  His most highly regarded works are his five-part fantasies for viols :  Thurston Dart is quoted as saying, "despite some slipshod part-writing, they are among the best five-part consorts of the time".  East was one of the most published composers of his era [ citation needed ] ; he published seven groups of compositions:
