Eugen Lindner (11 December 1858 Leipzig - 12 November 1915 Weimar) was a German composer, notably of opera. A friend of Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler , he was an important figure in musical scene in Weimar before the First World War. Lindner's earlier career was spent in Leipzig , where his recently completed opera Ramiro was first staged in September 1886 at the Neues Stadttheater, with Mahler conducting in his own first season there. Lindner was a pupil of Edmund Abesser and Gustav Kogel for the piano; of Volck and Friedrich Stack in composition and of Franz Götze in singing and, at the age of twenty, became a chorus master in his home town. He quickly allied himself stylistically with Wagner and began to conduct Wagner's works. He was also in demand as a singer and as a singing teacher but began to turn his attention more and more to composition. Eventually he was nominated as a Court (Imperial) Professor of Music in Weimar. Other works include the operas Der Meisterdieb ( The Master Thief ) (1889), to a libretto by Gustav Kastroff and the composer after Arthur Fitger's poem, and the unstaged opera Eldena . He produced many songs (over sixty, some with orchestral arrangements) for voice and piano in a romantic and dramatic, sometimes declamatory style, using post-Wagnerian harmony, mostly published by the Hermann Seemann Nachfolger Verlag to texts by such poets as Carl Busse, Ada Negri , Otto Roquette and Emil zu Schönaich-Carolath, whose almost exact contemporary he was. Lindner was sometimes attracted to exotic or eastern subjects, typified by the short song cycle "Lieder des Saidjah". Songs of Eugen Lindner
