Achille Simonetti (12 June 1857 â€“ 19 November 1928) was a prominent Italian violinist and composer , mainly resident in England and Ireland. He was mainly known as a chamber musician and teacher. Born in Turin on 12 June 1857,  Simonetti left his family in Bologna (this can be gleaned from his letter to Mr Hill (of Hills and Sons) written in 1922,  ) and completed his studies under Francesco Bianchi, Eugenio Cavallini , Giuseppe Gamba, Charles Dancla (regarded as the last exponent of the classical French school of violin playing),  and Camillo Sivori , the last pupil of Niccolo Paganini .  Simonetti died aged 71 in London on 19 November 1928.  Simonetti came to England in 1891,  embarking on a career as chamber musician. He became part of the first London Trio, an endeavour which occupied him from 1901 to 1912,  along with cellist William Whitehouse and pianist Amina Goodwin .  From 1912 to 1919, he was a professor of violin at the Royal Irish Academy of Music ,  and served as a teacher for many distinguished violinists, including Walter Starkie . Simonetti was also an early champion of the Brahms Violin Concerto , and wrote a cadenza for the work.
