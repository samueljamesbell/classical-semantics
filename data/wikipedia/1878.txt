Jens Bjerre Jacobsen (1903 – 3 January 1986) was a Danish composer and organist. Jacobsen was born in Aarhus but grew up in Salling , where his father was a Grundtvigian Community pastor in Rødding-Krejbjerg. Jacobsen learned to play the piano at an early age from the organist and composer Laurids Lauridsen. At 15, he got admission into the Royal Danish Academy of Music . The time spent at the Academy gave his earliest songs and choral work a strong element of Thomas Laub and Carl Nielsen . However, Jacobsen himself never acknowledged this, and claimed that his career as a composer only began after he moved to Paris.  Jacobsen became an organist in Paris. Alfred Cortot , the famous pianist and conductor, taught him composition and honed his piano skills. Cortot was a big influence on Jacobsen. Under the former's tutelage, Jacobsen made immense progress as a composer, a development that is specially noticeable in his music from the 1930s onwards.
