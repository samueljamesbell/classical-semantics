François Bouvard (c. 1684—1760) was a French composer of the Baroque era . Originally from Lyon , Bouvard began his career as a singer at the Paris Opéra at the age of sixteen. When the quality of his voice deteriorated, he went to study in Rome and devoted himself to playing the violin and composition. His first opera, the tragédie en musique Médus , appeared in Paris in 1702.
