Pieter (Pierre) van Maldere (16 October 1729) was a violinist and composer from the Southern Low Countries (present-day Belgium). Van Maldere was born in Brussels and educated as a violinist and composer , probably by the directors of the Brussels court chapel, Jean-Joseph Fiocco and Henri-Jacques de Croes . From 1749 he was a violinist at the court of governor of the Low Countries , Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine . From 1751 to 1753, Van Maldere was director of the Philarmonick Concerts in Dublin , where William Manwaring published, in December 1752, the Six Trios for 2 Fiddles and thorough Bass composed by Sieur Van Maldere . Van Maldere played in the Paris Concert Spirituel in August 1754. He accompanied the prince on his many travels, to France ( Paris ), Bohemia ( Prague ) and Austria ( Vienna ), where his two first comic operas were performed in Schönbrunn : Le Déguisement pastoral (1756) en Les Amours champêtres (1758). Van Maldere also played for the empress Maria Theresia in Vienna . His works were known to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Joseph Haydn . Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf notes him as one of the most important virtuosos of his time. Back in Brussels, Van Maldere composed a number of operas and over 40 symphonies , ouvertures and sonatas . In 1758, he was promoted valet de chambre to the prince. From 1763 to 1767, he was co-director of the Grand Théâtre ( Muntschouwburg , Théâtre de la Monnaie ), a period which ended in a financial fiasco. Ignaz Vitzthumb (1724-1816) was the conductor of the Muntschouwburg in those years. Among Van Maldere's students at the court chapel are the violinist Joseph Gehot (1756-na 1795) and the clarinettist Amand Vanderhagen (1753-1822). Van Maldere died in his home city of Brussels.  After his decease, his brother succeeded him as first violinist of the court chapel. Van Maldere's music was published in London , Paris and Brussels (as is clear from the thematic catalogue), and performed at many European courts. As his Flemish name did not sound familiar to music scribes, many variants are found in the sources, including Vanmaltre, Van Maltere, Vanmonder, van Maldern, Wan Maldere, Wanmalder, Vam Maldere, Maldera, even Vand'Elmar (B-Bc 73150). While Van Maldere's chamber music shows late-baroque characteristics and Corelli 's influence, his violin sonatas and symphonies testify to the formation of the early classical 'Viennese' symphony . Most of the symphonies are in three parts, and contain elements as thematic contrast or modulating development. The second movement sometimes is a binary Lied form, the final occasionally a rondo form. A number of works have the 'classical' four movements (RomM 51 in C, and 120 in F; the Sonata a 3, RomM 20 in D). Van Maldere's works circulated throughout Europe in manuscript parts as well as in print. According to RISM (Répertoire International de Sources Musicales) , manuscripts of his works are found in 21 libraries in 10 different countries (Belgium, Czech Republic , Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia , Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States).
Van Maldere's compositions were printed by publishers in London , Paris , Dublin and Brussels ; even after his decease reprints were issued, such as the Six favourite overtures in 8 parts, opus 4 (Londen, ca. 1770). Only one source of Van Maldere's vocal compositions has survived: his opéra-comique "Le déguisement pastoral" (1756) is still kept in the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna . A popular vocal composition to music by Van Maldere was 'Ach wiederholt mir Jesu Leiden', an arrangement of the Grave from his Symphony op.4 nr. 5, for two sopranos, strings and bass (one source has two flutes added). A number of his works were attributed to other composers, such as Joseph Haydn (RomM 80 in B♭), and Josef Mysliviček , whose symphony in C turned out to be Van Maldere's op.4 nr. 2.
