Uuno (Kalervo) Klami (20 September 1900 – 29 May 1961) was a Finnish composer. He was born in Virolahti . Many of his works are related to the Kalevala . He was influenced by French and Spanish music, and especially by Maurice Ravel , for whom he had a particular esteem.  He participated in five armed conflicts, including two wars in Karelia , the Finnish Civil War , the Winter War of 1939-40 and  the Continuation War of 1941-44. Klami studied music in Helsinki with Erkki Melartin and later in Paris and Vienna . His main works include the Kalevala Suite and the unfinished ballet Whirls . The oratorio Psalmus (1936) has a unique place in Finnish sacred music and is one of the most highly regarded works by a Finn other than Sibelius. [ citation needed ] Klami also experimented with the symphonic form in his two Symphonies (1938 and 1945) and Symphonie enfantine (1927), and the concerto form in his two Piano Concertos (No. 1 Une nuit à Montmartre and No. 2 for Piano and Strings) and the Violin Concerto (1943). Being a master of miniature orchestral works, the orchestral suite Sea Pictures is also regarded as one of his major achievements. On the recommendation of Sibelius he was granted a small lifetime income from the government. In 1959 he was made a member of the Finnish Academy (one of Finland's highest honors). The energetic Karelian Rhapsody was the first Finnish orchestral work to be published in Finland, and a long-time favourite in radio concert programs. Klami died of a heart attack in Virolahti at age 60 while sailing his favorite boat "Miina".
