Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin (Avignon, ca. 1690 – Paris, 13 January 1768) was a French flutist and composer of the late Baroque period. Born in Provence , Buffardin was a flute soloist at the court of the Elector of Saxony in Dresden from 1715 to 1749. He was the teacher of flautists Johann Joachim Quantz , Pietro Grassi Florio , and Johann Sebastian Bach 's elder brother, Johann Jacob Bach , whom he met in Constantinople sometime before 1712. Buffardin's Sonata for Flute is the only work which it is certain he wrote. His Concerto à cinq in E minor was written for his virtuosic student Quantz [ citation needed ] , who said of Buffardin : "Il ne jouait que des choses rapides: car c'est en cela qu'excellait mon maître." (Translation: "He only played fast pieces; for in that my master excelled.")
