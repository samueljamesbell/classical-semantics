Andreas Hofer (ca. 1629 – 25 February 1684) was a German composer of the Baroque period. Hofer was born at Reichenhall .  He was a contemporary of Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber , whose predecessor he was in Salzburg in his office of Inspector and Hofkapellmeister, i.e., director of the court orchestra.  Like Biber, Hofer was noted for his large-scale polychoral sacred works. It has been suggested that Hofer was the composer of the famous Missa Salisburgensis à 53 voci , which earlier had been attributed to Orazio Benevoli ,  although it is now accepted that it was the work of Biber.  Hofer died at Salzburg .  His compositions contain significant roles for instruments like the cornetto , trombone or sackbut and trumpet .  Little of his music has been performed or recorded in recent times; several scores, however, have been made available.
