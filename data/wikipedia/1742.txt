Dismas Hataš ( German : Hattasch ; 1 December 1724 – 13 October 1777) was a Bohemian composer and violinist of the early classical period. Hataš was born in Vysoké Mýto into a musical family. Many of his relatives were cantors and organists in Bohemia. In May 1751 he married the singer Anna Franziska Benda, the sister of Franz and Jiří Antonín Benda ,  and in October of that year was recommended by Jiří Antonín for a position as a violinist in the court orchestra in Gotha . He was to keep this position for the rest of his life. In 1756 his son Jindřich Krištof Hataš was born, whom he taught to play the violin, and who later became a composer. From December 1768 to early 1769 he performed with his wife and colleagues from Gotha in four concerts in the Netherlands.  Dismas' youger brother, Jan Václav Hataš (1727–1752) was also a composer. Hataš' compositional style is typical of that which prevailed in Northern Germany in the middle of the 18th century. It preserves many baroque idioms while absorbing many classical developments which were already common in other parts of Europe. His output includes:
