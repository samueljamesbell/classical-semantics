Hans Buchner (also Joannes Buchner , Hans von Constanz , born 26 October 1483 in Ravensburg ; died March 1538, probably in Konstanz ) was an important German organist and composer . Buchner was a student of Paul Hofhaimer , and may have worked for the emperor Maximilian I while Hofhaimer was away. From 1506 he worked in Constance as the cathedral organist. His relationship with Heinrich Isaac is unclear, but three of the odd-numbered sequence verses he set are in the same transpositions as the Choralis Constantinus (he also set Victimae paschali laudes , whereas Isaac used a different Easter sequence, Laudes salvatori ). When, in the course of the Reformation , the bishop was forced to move his seat to Meersburg , Buchner followed him to continue in his post, while maintaining a residence in Constance. In 1529 he applied for a position at Speyer , but apparently demanded too high a salary. He was often called to inspect new organs, such as those of Zurich and Heidelberg . His most important legacy is the Fundamentbuch, a collection of organ music that also includes an introduction to the techniques of playing and improvising on plainchant . Buchner's Collected Organ Works (SÃ¤mtliche Orgelwerke) are edited by Jost Harro Schmidt as volumes 54 & 55 of Das Erbe deutscher Musik (Litolff/Frankfurt, 1974) Amongst his pupils was the Swiss organist and composer, Fridolin Sicher .
