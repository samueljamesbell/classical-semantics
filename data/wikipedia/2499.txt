John Mundy (or Munday ) (before 1555 â€“ 29 June 1630) was an English composer , virginalist and organist of the Renaissance period. The son and pupil of the eminent composer William Mundy , he was organist at Eton, and succeeded John Marbeck after his death in 1585 as organist at St George's Chapel, Windsor . He received a bachelor of music degree from the University of Oxford in 1586, and his doctorate in 1624. In 1585 he was appointed joint organist of Westminster Abbey with Nathaniel Giles , a post he maintained until his death in 1630. Mundy was one of the earliest English madrigalists . He published a volume of Songs and Psalms in 1594, and contributed a madrigal, Lightly she whipped o'er the dales , to The Triumphs of Oriana (1601), a compilation of madrigals by Thomas Morley in honour of Queen Elizabeth I . He composed sacred music in English and Latin, including music for the Book of Common Prayer , and is represented in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book by five pieces, including a magnificent set of variations on the popular song Goe from my window and a whimsical but fine miniature, Munday's Joy . He also wrote a setting of the recusant Chidiock Tichborne 's poem My prime of youth before the latter's gruesome execution in 1586 for his part in the Babington plot . Mundy died on 29 June 1630 at Windsor , succeeded in his post there by his colleague Nathaniel Giles .
