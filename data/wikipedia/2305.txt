Désiré Magnus ( né Magnus Deutz ; 13 June 1828 in Brussels – 17 December 1883 in Paris ) was a Belgian concert pianist , teacher and composer of salon music who published under the pseudonym D Magnus . Magnus studied piano with G. J. Vollweiler (1770–1847) in Heidelberg and also at the Brussels Conservatory , receiving the First Prize in 1843.   After several successful concert tours in England, Germany, Russia, Spain and other countries, he settled in Paris, and quickly gained a reputation as pianist, teacher, composer, and musical critic.   Magnus' performance on the Steinway concert-grand piano at the Exhibition Universelle of 1867 inspired a lithograph by Amédée de Noé .
