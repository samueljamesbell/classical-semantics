Viktor (or Victor ) Ernst Nessler (28 January 1841 –  28 May 1890) was an Alsatian composer who worked mainly in Leipzig . Nessler was born at Baldenheim near Sélestat , Alsace .  At Strasbourg he began his university career with the study of theology , but he concluded it with the production of a light opera entitled Fleurette (1864). To complete his knowledge of music Nessler went to Leipzig to study with Moritz Hauptmann . In 1870, he was appointed chorus master and later conductor of the Caroltheater, Leipzig.   His musically conservative, mock-Gothic, fairy-tale operas, notably Der Rattenfänger von Hameln ( The Pied Piper of Hamelin ) (1879) and Der Trompeter von Säkkingen (1884), based on the famous poem by Joseph Viktor von Scheffel , were very popular in the 19th century. The great conductor Artur Nikisch composed an orchestral arrangement of material from Der Trompeter von Säkkingen . Besides a number of other operas, Nessler wrote many songs and choral works; but it is with the Trompeter von Säkkingen that his name is most closely associated. In 1895 a monument to him by the sculptor Alfred Marzolff was erected in Strasbourg, the place of his death.
