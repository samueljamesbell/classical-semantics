Domenico Mazzocchi (1592 – 21 January 1665 in Veja, now ?Vejano , baptised in nearby Cività Castellana , in Lazio region's Viterbo Province ) was an Italian Baroque composer of only vocal music, of the generation after Claudio Monteverdi . He was a learned Roman lawyer, studied music with Giovanni Maria Nanino ('Nanini'), also in Rome , and entered the service of cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini in 1621. He is associated with providing music for the popes, particularly Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, later Pope Urban VIII , until Domenico's death in Rome on January 21, 1665. His younger brother, Virgilio Mazzocchi , was a less notable Roman composer and had a similar career as a Vatican music provider.
