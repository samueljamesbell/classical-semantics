Václav Jan Kopřiva (pseudonym Urtica  ) (8 February 1708 in Cítoliby , near Louny – 7 June 1789 in Cítoliby) was a Bohemian composer and organist. Kopřiva was a son of the miller Václav Kopřiva (1672–?), from the neighboring village Brloh , and his wife Juditka Rozumová (1677–?). He received his first musical education from his godfather Martin Antonín Kalina , who was a cantor and a representative of another important music family in Cítoliby. He completed his studies in Prague , becoming an organist at the Crusaders' Church and studying with Franz Joseph Dollhopf . Thereafter he worked as a cantor and organist in Cítoliby. With his wife Terézia, he had two sons Karel Blažej Kopřiva and Jan Jáchym Kopřiva , who both also became composers. His spiritual compositions have typical baroque characteristics and they employ pastoral poems and folksongs. His notable pupils include Jan Nepomuk Vent , Jan Adam Galina , Jakub Lokaj and both of his sons.
