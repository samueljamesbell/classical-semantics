Heinrich Reinhardt (1865–1922) was an Austrian composer . He died on 31 January 1922 in Vienna and is buried at the Döbling Cemetery . Reinhardt was born on 13 April 1865 in Pressburg (now Bratislava ). The son of a jeweller, he went to Vienna to study at the conservatory of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde where he was one of Anton Bruckner 's pupils. He became an accomplished pianist and organist , and his familiarity with several other instruments later served him well as orchestrator of his own works and those of others. Between 1890 and 1900 he published numerous songs , piano and salon pieces, as well as an opera , Die Minnekönigin (1895). He also wrote music reports for the Neue Freie Presse , Neues Wiener Journal and Die Zeit , but abandoned this after the tremendous success of his first operetta , Das süsse Mädel ( Carltheater , 25 October 1901). It opened a new phase for Viennese operetta, being more overtly in the song and dance musical comedy style. However, Reinhardt's dozen later works were eclipsed by those of Edmund Eysler , Franz Lehár , Oscar Straus and Leo Fall .
