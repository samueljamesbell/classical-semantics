Rosa Giacinta Badalla (ca. 1660 – ca. 1710) was an Italian composer and Benedictine nun . The first record of her is in the lists of the monastery of Saint Radegonda in Milan from 1678. Claudia Sessa , Claudia Rusca , and Chiara Margarita Cozzolani were also active at Milanese convents during the same period. She had only one printed collection, Motetti a voce sola (1684, Venice), a book of solo motets . Kendrick identifies it as "remarkable among Milanese solo motet books…for its patent vocal viruosity, motivic originality and self-assured compositional technique".  There are also two surviving secular cantatas , Vuò cercando and O fronde care , to which Badalla wrote the text.
