Rudi Stephan (29 July 1887 – 29 September 1915) was a German composer of great promise who, shortly before the First World War , was considered one of the leading talents among his generation.   He died in the war aged 28. Stephan was born at Worms , Grand Duchy of Hesse .  He became a composition pupil of Bernhard Sekles at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt and of Heinrich Schwartz and Rudolf Louis in Munich , where he settled after completing his studies in 1908. He left only a few works: his liking for pointedly neutral titles along the lines of 'Music for ...' has caused him to be seen as a forerunner of the 'New Objectivity' of the post-war era, but his music is in fact in a hyper-expressive late- Romantic idiom which has more plausibly been seen by some as a kind of proto- Expressionism . His father, a Privy Councillor , was able to finance the performance of his early works, which at first met with incomprehension, but the premiere of his 1912 Music for Orchestra in Worms was a major critical breakthrough. He completed his only opera, Die ersten Menschen , shortly after the outbreak of the war, and it was eventually premiered in Frankfurt, five years after his death from a bullet in the brain fired by a Russian sharpshooter, at Chodaczków Wielki near Tarnopol on the Galician Front , now Ukraine. His complete orchestral works have been recorded by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra conducted by Oleg Caetani .
