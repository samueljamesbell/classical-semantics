Mikołaj Gomółka (c. 1535 – after 30 April 1591, most probably 5 March 1609) was a Polish Renaissance composer , member of the royal court of Sigismund II Augustus , where he was a singer, flutist and trumpeter. Gomółka was born in Sandomierz . Between 1545 and 1563 he stayed at the royal court, where he learned to play the flute , the 'sztort' (an old Polish wind instrument , prototype of the bassoon ), the violin and the lute , and then he became a royal chapel musician with full rights. Having left the court he fulfilled various social and legal functions in Sandomierz ; for some time he stayed at the court of the Kraków bishop Piotr Myszkowski (to whom he dedicated his work "Melodies for the Polish Psalter"); he conducted mining researches near Muszyna and also stayed at the court of Jan Zamoyski in Kraków , where he was still living on 30 April 1591; this is the last known date of his life. The only preserved work by Gomółka is a collection of 150 independent compositions to the text of David's Psalter by Jan Kochanowski , for four-part unaccompanied mixed choir . The music is fully subordinated to the contents and the expressive layer of the text; he illustrates the mood or particular words by means of musical devices. In some works the composer applies dance rhythms characteristic of canzonetta . The "Melodies for the Polish Psalter" are a valuable monument of Old Polish culture showing the lay achievements of the renaissance adapted to the Polish conditions.
