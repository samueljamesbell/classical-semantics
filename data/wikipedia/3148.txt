Johannes de Stokem (or Johannes Stokem , last name also Prato , Pratis , Stockem , Stokhem , Stoken , Stoccken , Stoecken , Sthoken ;  c. 1445 – 1487 or 1501), was a Flemish composer of the Renaissance . He is considered to be part of the post- Dufay generation in France.  He was a friend of Johannes Tinctoris , another composer of the period.  Stokem was born in 1445, probably in Stokkem near Liège . For parts of his life, he served under Beatrice of Aragon , the Queen of Hungary, and as part of the Papal Choir in Rome. He died in either 1487 or 1501.  His piece, Brunette , was published in the Odhecaton and is an early example of a genre of music commonly known as "little brown-eyed girl." It is one of the few five-voice works found in the Odhecaton.
