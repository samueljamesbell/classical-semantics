Urbán de Vargas (1606–1656) was a Spanish baroque composer. Urbano Barguilla y de Ripalda was born in 1606 in Falces , south of Navarra . He studied with the maestro de capilla at Burgos , Luis Bernardo Jalón , known for his polemic activities and radical views on music. As was common among the chapel masters of the period, Vargas passed the cathedrals of Huesca , Pamplona , Daroca, Calatayud, the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza , and finally the Valencia , where he died at the age of 50.  Vargas' music is in a complex polyphonic early baroque idiom. In his life he was highly regarded both as composer and organist working with other important Iberian musicians of the period including Juan Bautista Comes , Carlos Patiño (1600–1675), and the Portuguese monk Fray Manuel Correa (ca. 1590-1653) maestro de capilla in Zaragoza's other cathedral La Seo .
