George Alexander Lee (1802 – 8 October 1851) was an English musician. Lee was born in London, the son of Henry Lee, a pugilist and innkeeper. He became "tiger" to Lord Barrymore, and his singing led to his being educated for the musical profession. After appearing as a tenor at the theatres in Dublin and London, he joined in producing opera at the Tottenham Street theatre in 1829, and afterwards was connected with musical productions at Drury Lane and Covent Garden . He married Harriet Waylett , a popular singer.  Her death, on 26 April 1851, caused Lee a shock from which he never rallied.  He died at his lodgings in Newton Terrace, Kennington on 8 October 1851 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery .  Lee composed music for a number of plays and also many songs, including the popular "Come where the Aspens quiver", and for a short time had a music-selling business in the Quadrant.
