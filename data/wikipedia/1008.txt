Giovanni Paolo Cima (c. 1570 â€“ 1622) was an Italian composer and organist in the early Baroque era. He was a contemporary of Claudio Monteverdi and Girolamo Frescobaldi , though not as well known (then or now) as either of those men. Cima came from a family of musicians and was a leading musical figure in Milan . From 1595 he served as director of music and organist at the chapel of Santa Maria presso San Celso in Milan. His Concerti ecclesiastici were published in 1610. Cima's church music was generally conservative, but his instrumental works were more innovative. He was the first composer to publish trio sonatas and made use in them of the combination of two treble instruments and the basso continuo . Cima died in Milan at about the age of 52. His son Giovanni Battista Cima is not to be confused with the artist painter Giovanni Battista Cima , called Cima da Conegliano, who was no relation.
