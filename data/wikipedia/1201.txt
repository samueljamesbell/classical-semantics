Gustave Doret (20 September 1866 – 19 April 1943) was a Swiss composer and conductor . Doret was born in 1866 in Aigle , Switzerland . He studied at the Berlin Academy of Music with Joseph Joachim , and then at the Conservatoire de Paris with Théodore Dubois and Jules Massenet . His career as a conductor began in 1894 in Paris, where he led the first performance of Debussy 's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune . He was second conductor of the Concerts d'Harcourt from 1893 to 1895 and director of the Opera-comique in the 1890s and 1900s. He was also the founder of the Théâtre du Jorat , in Mézières . His two serious operas, heavily indebted to Massenet, were performed in Paris; his light opera and other stage works were far more popular across French-speaking Europe.
