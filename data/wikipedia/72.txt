Jacob Niclas Ahlström (5 June 1805 in Visby , Gotland – 14 May 1857 in Stockholm ) was a Swedish Kapellmeister and composer. Beginning his studies at Uppsala University in 1824, Ahlström dropped out due to lack of money and joined a touring theatrical troupe . From 1832 to 1842, he served as a cathedral organist and music teacher in Västerås and then became a Court Kapellmeister and organist in Stockholm until his death. In 1845, he held a concert in Berlin, during which he played Swedish folk songs and dances . Ahlström composed two operas based on libretti by Frans Hedberg , incidental music (for plays such as Agne , Positivhalaren , Ringaren i Notre Dame , and Hinko och Urdur ), a vocal symphony , chamber music , and lieder . Together with Per Conrad Boman , he published Svenska folksånger, folkdanser och folklekar , the best-known collection of Swedish folk songs which appeared during the 19th century. In 1852, he also published the Musikalisk fickordbok (Musical Pocket Book), which enjoyed several reissues.
