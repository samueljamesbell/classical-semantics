Paola Massarenghi (born August 5, 1565) was an Italian composer. Only one of her works survives, Quando spiega l'insegn'al sommo padre , a spiritual madrigal .  It was printed in Arcangelo Gherardini 's Primo libro de madrigali a cinque voci . The publication, from Ferrara in 1585,  is dedicated to Alfonso Fontanelli , and while other contributors are listed in the dedication, Massarenghi was left out.  Massarenghi probably came from a wealthy family, since they were able to get Duke Ranuccio I Farnese to help get a musical education for Massarenghi's younger brother, Giovanni Battista Massarenghi , also a composer.
