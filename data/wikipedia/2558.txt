Maurice Ohana (12 June 1913 – 13 November 1992) was a French composer. Ohana was born in Casablanca , Morocco (during the French protectorate ). His father, an Andalusian of Sephardic-Jewish descent, had been born in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar , while his mother had Andalusian- Castilian origins.   Ohana inherited British citizenship from his father.  He originally studied architecture , but abandoned this in favour of a musical career, initially as a pianist . He studied under Alfredo Casella in Rome , returning to France in 1946. Around this time he founded the "Groupe Zodiaque", which fought against prevailing musical dogma. His mature musical style shows the influence of Mediterranean folk music , particularly the Andalusian cante jondo . In 1976 he took French citizenship.  Ohana's output includes the choral works Office des Oracles and Avoaha (1992), three string quartets (1963, 1980, 1989), and two suites for ten-string guitar : Si le jour paraît... (1963)  and Cadran lunaire (1981-2),  as well as a Tiento for six-string guitar (1957).  He also wrote operas entitled Syllabaire pour Phèdre and La Celestina . He is also known for his extensive use of microtonality ; for example, third- and quarter-tones in pieces like Le Tombeau de Debussy and Si le jour paraît... . He was influenced by the use of microintervals in the cante jondo .  Ohana rarely composed for large symphony orchestra: Synaxis (1966), Livre des Prodiges (1979) and T'Harân-Ngô (1974). He composed two cello concertos, one piano concerto and a guitar concerto (1958; dedicated to Narciso Yepes ).   Ohana died in Paris.
