Paul Abraham (Hungarian: Ábrahám Pál ; 2 November 1892 – 6 May 1960) was a Jewish-Hungarian composer of operettas , who scored major successes in the German-speaking world.  His specialty - and own innovation - was the insertion of jazz interludes into operettas.  Abraham was born in Apatin , Austria-Hungary (today Serbia ), and studied at the Royal National Hungarian Academy of Music in Budapest from 1910 to 1916. He studied cello with Adolf Schiffer and composition with Viktor Herzfeld . Like many other composers of operettas, Paul Abraham started with works of a serious nature. During the decade following his studies he wrote, among other things, sacred music, string quartets and a concerto for violoncello. When he was appointed conductor at the Budapest Operetta Theatre in 1927 he found his way to this more popular art form which was more suited to his talent. His first operetta, Der Gatte des Fräuleins , was written in 1928. With his third, Viktoria und ihr Husar (1930) , he achieved a resounding success. Through this work, and the next two operettas from 1931 and 1933 Die Blume von Hawaii ( lit. The Flower of Hawaii") and Ball im Savoy he became renowned worldwide. He also wrote numerous film scores. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 forced Abraham to abandon his domicile in Berlin and leave Germany. He was unwanted both as a Jew, and as the author of Die Blume von Hawaii , considered a piece of " degenerate art " by the Nazis,  and telling the story of a German sailor who falls in love with a Hawaiian girl.  Via Vienna and Paris he moved to Cuba where he earned a modest living as a pianist and later emigrated to New York City. After a mental breakdown he was in February 1946 committed to the Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, later to the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens. In May 1956 he returned to live in Hamburg, Germany, where he received treatment at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf . He died four years later, aged 67. Works cited
