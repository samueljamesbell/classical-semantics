The pair worked together on several operas, including Le petit page ou La prison d'état (1800) and Flaminius à Corinthe (1801). Isouard adopted the pseudonym Nicolò (or Nicolò de Malte) and found rapid success in the field of opéra comique with Michel-Ange (1802) and L'intrigue aux fenêtres (1805).

His brother Joseph (1794–1863) had a career as a singer and opera director before being named inspector of historic monuments in Rouen . Nicolas Isouard was buried in Notre-Dame-des-Victoires . A bust of the composer was placed on one of the facades of both the Théâtre de l'Opéra-Comique and the Palais Garnier , and one of the main squares in Paris was given his name.
